            "description": "During 2019, Connahs Quay resident, John Coppack handed a reel of 1/4\" recording tape to his distant cousin and fellow Deeside community heritage enthusiast, John Butler. The tape had been found languishing in an attic -but markings on the box suggested it contained something of significant local interest. Using equipment which had been donated by friends and refurbished by JB, a media hardware engineer of the old-school, the contents of the tape could, once again, be enjoyed. The tape contained John Coppacks original 1968 recording of the time when BBC radio's Franklin Englemann visited Connahs Quay and chatted with various local people in the community. Research suggests that this, \"off-air\", domestic recording is the only known copy of the program which has survived to the present time. In this extract the presenter speaks with George Kerr, the first manager of Connahs Quay's newly opened Civic Centre and swimming baths. The full program also included an interview with local Dee salmon-net fisherman, Bill Latham. Thanks to various contemporary photographs that have been donated by Deeside residents during 2019, an a/v presentation of this item is now available to view via the link below. It is hoped that illustrated versions of the various interview extracts from this vintage radio program will be published in due course.",

Ladies were carried in them on the way to balls, parties and to pay social calls.\n\nThis chair was used to convey Miss Stokes, the bride of one of Tenby's Mayors to church in Haverfordwest, to be married in 1872.  It was presented to Tenby Museum in April 1896 by the Richards family of Croft House, who had played a prominent part in the town's local affairs.\n\n[Source: Tenby Museum and Art Gallery]",

On the 30th of May 2018 Laura, along with two CBMWC Seasonal Volunteers, was called out to monitor a seal exhibiting unusual behaviour on Traeth Gwyn Beach. Recollection as follows: &ldquo;On 30th May 2018 a member of the public came into the CBMWC visitor centre after spotting a distressed seal on Traeth Gwyn beach. Seals do spend time resting on the shore but because Traeth Gwyn is a busy beach where many people walk their dogs I decided to head out onto the beach to make sure the seal wasn&rsquo;t being disturbed. Myself and two seasonal volunteers (Jason Burk and Yasmin Wright) quickly hurried along the beach in search of the seal which we assumed was an Atlantic grey seal &hellip; but we were wrong! After rushing across the beach we eventually found the seal which was surrounded by a group of people. We asked people to move back and then realised it was in fact a young common seal, not an Atlantic grey seal which we had previously assumed. Common seals aren&rsquo;t typically found in Wales so we knew it was in trouble. After contacting British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) and speaking to colleagues we decided to remove the seal from the beach. Two local volunteers, Chris and Karen brought a spare dog cage for us to carry seal in and with help from a BDMLR volunteer we were able to safely put the seal into the cage and carry it from the beach. It was hoped that the seal could be transported to a rescue facility where it could be rehabilitated however after speaking to a vet over the phone it become apparent that the seal was very unwell. Based on our descriptions and videos we sent, the vet suspected the seal had lungworm and was in too poor a condition to survive. We then worked with BDMLR to transport the seal to a local vet where it could be put down. A very sad ending to the day!&rdquo; Description of photos: 1) Common Seal on Traeth Gwyn Beach, Ceredigion. 2) Common Seal on Traeth Gwyn Beach, Ceredigion. 3) Common Seal on Traeth Gwyn Beach, Ceredigion.

The officer took him to the police station and examined his papers, and found a sailor's discharge book and a seamen's union card which bore the defendant's name and gave his nationality and place of birth as Swiss.

There was also a registration form issued from the Newport Police on 29th September last, which stated that Brann was a native of Sweden. The officer after examining the papers said to Brann, âYou're a German and all these books are false.â Brann replied, âI am a Swiss, I tell you.â Johnson then said, âAll you say is lies.

Indeed, it is possible that the name Dinbren, referred to in some of the early records from 1626 as Tynbrin (Ty yn Bryn = House in/on a Hill), is derived from the location of the manor of this estate. Another possibility is that it is an old compressed form of \"Dinas Bran\". In the 17th century, many of the properties in Dinbren were owned by the Wynnstay Estate. Over the next 200 years a number of these were acquired by Dinbren Hall and the estate grew. In the latter half of the 18th century the estate was owned by David Roberts, being sold to Richard Jones in the 1800s. Richard Jones was a man of independent means who lived in the Hall with his wife Emma and three servants. The present Hall, a two storey Georgian country house, has a date of 1793 and was built on the site of an earlier house, part of which was incorporated into the later building until the house was reduced in size in the late 1950s.",

She was born in Rumney, South Wales, to Italian parents. She was in the Land Army at Church Farm Leominster Heriford. Later in the 60s, my mam would visit the farm in the school holidays, and she would take my sister and me for a weeks holiday. We also visited the farm in 1981, taking my wife and my children. We told the farm's new owners that my mam was a Land Girl, and they made us feel welcome. We had a walk all around the farm with the owner, and my mother didn't stop telling us her memories. In one barn, my mam said, \"in this barn, I wrote a poem about my favourite horse Poppet\", and although the barn had been renovated and all the old plaster hacked off, my mams poem had been left and not disturbed.\"\n\n\"Just down the road from the farm was the Cadbury's Chocolate Factory. My Mam told me that the lorry would come and collect the milk every morning from the farm and take it to the Cadbury's Factory. One morning a man came from the Cadbury's Factory to tell my Mam that the cream content was low for the amount of milk. So, one morning after milking the cows, my Mam put the milk ready for collection, and my Mam hid out of sight. After a while, one of the land girls came in and started to skim the cream of the top of the milk.\"",

            "description": "Reactor exit point, radiation monitoring equipment in Trawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station.\nTrawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station was constructed between 1959 and 1963 to architectural specifications by Sir Basil Spence. It started service in 1965 and its twin Magnox reactors generated electricity for 26 years before it reached the end of its service life in 1991. The first inland civil nuclear power station in the UK, it used fresh water for cooling drawn from Trawsfynydd lake, originally created in the 1920s as part of a hydro-electric project at Maentwrog.\nThe complex comprised accommodation grouped in four buildings, each of which fulfilled one of the station's distinct functions - reactor buildings, a turbine hall, fuel disposal areas and an electricity substation. These were arranged compactly and linked by covered walkways. The reactor buildings, which housed the station's twin Magnox reactors, were constructed of reinforced concrete and, at 180 feet in height, were the most dominant feature of the site. The Central Electricity Generating Board was keen to recognise that Trawsfynydd was a Welsh power station and so the practice produced a vast 'mosaic' in boulder-sized pebbles in the form of a Welsh dragon which formed the paving of the central court.\nTrawsfynydd Power Station is unique in that the power station was built inland adjacent to a lake which provided cooling water when the station was operational. The power station is set within extensive landscaped grounds designed by Sylvia Crowe, who also commented on the setting of the building to complement its wider landscape within the Snowdonia National Park. After 26 years in production, the decommissioning of Trawsfynydd began in 1991. It is expected that site clearance will be carried out over the next 100 years. The reactor buildings, which remain on the site, have been be clad to become safestore buildings.\nAll fuel has been removed from the reactors and decommissioning is well underway. 2010 saw the implementation of the Accelerated Care and Maintenance Business Case, and activity during the reporting period was focused on the delivery of an accelerated decommissioning plan.\nRef.

Cafodd ei rhoi ar waith ym 1965 a bu ei hadweithyddion Magnox dwbl yn cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd cyn i'r atomfa ddod i ddiwedd ei hoes ym 1991. Trawsfynydd oedd yr atomfa sifil fewndirol gyntaf i gael ei chodi yn y DU, a deuai'r dÅµr croyw ar gyfer oeri'r adweithyddion o lyn Trawsfynydd, a grÃªwyd yn wreiddiol yn y 1920au fel rhan o gynllun trydan dÅµr ym Maentwrog.\nRoedd ar y safle bedwar grÅµp o adeiladau, yr oedd pob un ohonynt yn cyflawni un o swyddogaethau penodol yr atomfa - adeiladau'r adweithyddion, neuadd tyrbinau, ardaloedd gwaredu tanwydd ac is-orsaf drydan. Cafodd y rhain eu trefnu'n daclus gyda'i gilydd a'u cysylltu Ã¢ rhodfeydd Ã¢ tho drostynt. Cafodd yr adeiladau lle gosodwyd adweithyddion dwbl yr orsaf eu gwneud o goncrit cyfnerth a'r rhain, a oedd yn cyrraedd uchder o 180 o droedfeddi, oedd nodwedd amlycaf y safle. Roedd y Bwrdd Cynhyrchu Trydan Canolog yn awyddus i gydnabod mai gorsaf drydan Gymreig oedd Trawsfynydd ac felly defnyddiwyd 'cerigos' maint clogfeini i greu mosaig enfawr ar ffurf draig a oedd yn rhan o bafin y cwrt canolog.\nTrawsfynydd oedd yr unig atomfa i gael ei hadeiladu ar safle mewndirol yn agos at lyn, a fu'n darparu dÅµr oeri pan oedd yr orsaf drydan yn gweithio. Mae'r atomfa wedi'i gosod mewn tiroedd wedi'u tirlunio helaeth a gynlluniwyd gan Sylvia Crowe, a nododd hefyd sut y cafodd yr adeiladau eu lleoli i ymdoddi i dirwedd ehangach Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri. Ar Ã´l cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd, dechreuwyd digomisiynu'r atomfa ym 1991. Disgwylir y bydd yn cymryd 100 mlynedd eto i glirio'r safle. Bu'n rhaid gorchuddio adeiladau'r adweithyddion, sy'n parhau ar y safle, i'w gwneud yn adeiladau storfa ddiogel.\nMae'r holl danwydd wedi cael ei dynnu o'r adweithyddion erbyn hyn ac mae'r gwaith digomisiynu wedi cychwyn ers tro byd. Yn 2010 cafodd yr Achos Busnes Gofal a Chynnal Cyflym ei roi ar waith, ac yn ystod y cyfnod adrodd rhoddwyd y sylw pennaf i weithredu cynllun digomisiynu cyflym.\nRef.DS2010_540_008",

            "description": "Reactor entry point, radiation monitoring equipment in Trawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station.\nTrawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station was constructed between 1959 and 1963 to architectural specifications by Sir Basil Spence. It started service in 1965 and its twin Magnox reactors generated electricity for 26 years before it reached the end of its service life in 1991. The first inland civil nuclear power station in the UK, it used fresh water for cooling drawn from Trawsfynydd lake, originally created in the 1920s as part of a hydro-electric project at Maentwrog.\nThe complex comprised accommodation grouped in four buildings, each of which fulfilled one of the station's distinct functions - reactor buildings, a turbine hall, fuel disposal areas and an electricity substation. These were arranged compactly and linked by covered walkways. The reactor buildings, which housed the station's twin Magnox reactors, were constructed of reinforced concrete and, at 180 feet in height, were the most dominant feature of the site. The Central Electricity Generating Board was keen to recognise that Trawsfynydd was a Welsh power station and so the practice produced a vast 'mosaic' in boulder-sized pebbles in the form of a Welsh dragon which formed the paving of the central court.\nTrawsfynydd Power Station is unique in that the power station was built inland adjacent to a lake which provided cooling water when the station was operational. The power station is set within extensive landscaped grounds designed by Sylvia Crowe, who also commented on the setting of the building to complement its wider landscape within the Snowdonia National Park. After 26 years in production, the decommissioning of Trawsfynydd began in 1991. It is expected that site clearance will be carried out over the next 100 years. The reactor buildings, which remain on the site, have been be clad to become safestore buildings.\nAll fuel has been removed from the reactors and decommissioning is well underway. 2010 saw the implementation of the Accelerated Care and Maintenance Business Case, and activity during the reporting period was focused on the delivery of an accelerated decommissioning plan.\nRef:DS2010_540_007",
            "descriptionCy": "Mynedfa i'r adweithydd, cyfarpar monitro ymbelydredd.\nCafodd Atomfa Trawsfynydd ei hadeiladu rhwng 1959 a 1963 yn Ã´l manylebau pensaernÃ¯ol Syr Basil Spence. Cafodd ei rhoi ar waith ym 1965 a bu ei hadweithyddion Magnox dwbl yn cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd cyn i'r atomfa ddod i ddiwedd ei hoes ym 1991. Trawsfynydd oedd yr atomfa sifil fewndirol gyntaf i gael ei chodi yn y DU, a deuai'r dÅµr croyw ar gyfer oeri'r adweithyddion o lyn Trawsfynydd, a grÃªwyd yn wreiddiol yn y 1920au fel rhan o gynllun trydan dÅµr ym Maentwrog.\nRoedd ar y safle bedwar grÅµp o adeiladau, yr oedd pob un ohonynt yn cyflawni un o swyddogaethau penodol yr atomfa - adeiladau'r adweithyddion, neuadd tyrbinau, ardaloedd gwaredu tanwydd ac is-orsaf drydan. Cafodd y rhain eu trefnu'n daclus gyda'i gilydd a'u cysylltu Ã¢ rhodfeydd Ã¢ tho drostynt. Cafodd yr adeiladau lle gosodwyd adweithyddion dwbl yr orsaf eu gwneud o goncrit cyfnerth a'r rhain, a oedd yn cyrraedd uchder o 180 o droedfeddi, oedd nodwedd amlycaf y safle. Roedd y Bwrdd Cynhyrchu Trydan Canolog yn awyddus i gydnabod mai gorsaf drydan Gymreig oedd Trawsfynydd ac felly defnyddiwyd 'cerigos' maint clogfeini i greu mosaig enfawr ar ffurf draig a oedd yn rhan o bafin y cwrt canolog.\nTrawsfynydd oedd yr unig atomfa i gael ei hadeiladu ar safle mewndirol yn agos at lyn, a fu'n darparu dÅµr oeri pan oedd yr orsaf drydan yn gweithio. Mae'r atomfa wedi'i gosod mewn tiroedd wedi'u tirlunio helaeth a gynlluniwyd gan Sylvia Crowe, a nododd hefyd sut y cafodd yr adeiladau eu lleoli i ymdoddi i dirwedd ehangach Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri. Ar Ã´l cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd, dechreuwyd digomisiynu'r atomfa ym 1991. Disgwylir y bydd yn cymryd 100 mlynedd eto i glirio'r safle. Bu'n rhaid gorchuddio adeiladau'r adweithyddion, sy'n parhau ar y safle, i'w gwneud yn adeiladau storfa ddiogel.\nMae'r holl danwydd wedi cael ei dynnu o'r adweithyddion erbyn hyn ac mae'r gwaith digomisiynu wedi cychwyn ers tro byd. Yn 2010 cafodd yr Achos Busnes Gofal a Chynnal Cyflym ei roi ar waith, ac yn ystod y cyfnod adrodd rhoddwyd y sylw pennaf i weithredu cynllun digomisiynu cyflym.\nRef:DS2010_540_007",

The factory was making parts for tanks â heavy industry. She was told to wear an overall and a turban. Rhondda girls wore curlers under their turbans. She had to check the straightness of tank tracks (not skilled). Sitting down but physical job. She describes it. Crude jokes. She got her O Level results (through the Western Mail) when she was there. She had to pack bundles of rods and varnish labels. Story of the blind worker and his dog. Shock of working a week in hand. She wore very heavy duty rubber gloves. She was warned of one man who might harass her. She learned a lot there. Later she went on to finish her A Levels and to a career.",

            "description": "Mair was a farmer's daughter, one of seven children, though the farm was sold after his death. Some of her sisters worked in a sewing factory. She left school at 16 to look for work, as coming from a large family it was necessary. She had wanted to be a nurse but she would have had to wait until she reached 19. She learned to type in the British School while looking for a job, and eventually got one in the milk factory, although she tried for work in the sewing factory too. This was in 1949 and she learned how to test the milk on the job. The relationship between the workers was good. Â£1 12 and 6 was her first wage and she gave most of it to her mother. She lived in Bodffordd and went to work on the bus. In the beginning she worked 9-5 but it didn't seem like a long day.  Later on she did nightshifts too and bought a bike to travel to work then. There wasn't a canteen there just a little cwtsh where they used to hang their coats. There wasn't even a kettle and they used to boil water for tea in the lab.  Mair worked there for 17 years until she lost her job in 1966 during a milk shortage, being a married woman with a husband to support her. It was supposed to be first in last out, she said, but not in her case. She was out of work for a while and it was awful, she said, signing on the dole, until she got another job.",
            "descriptionCy": "Ffermio oedd gwaith ei thad ac roedd Mair yn un o saith o blant.  Gwerthwyd fferm y teulu ar Ã´l marwolaeth ei thad.  Roedd rhai o'i chwiorydd yn gweithio mewn ffatri wnÃ¯o.  Aeth Mair i'r ysgol yn Llangefni, gan adael yn 16 oed, a chwilio am waith.   Eisiau bod yn nyrs yr oedd hi ond roedd yn rhaid aros tan iddi gyrraedd 19 oed. Dysgodd hi deipio yn y 'British School' traâi bod hi'n chwilio am swydd a chafodd hi swydd yn y ffatri llaeth, er ei bod hi'n trÃ¯o am swydd yn y ffatri wnÃ¯o hefyd.  Cafodd hi'r swydd ar Ã´l cael cyfweliad ac roedd hi'n teimlo'n hapus i gael swydd.  Yn 1949 yr oedd hynny a dysgodd hi sut i brofi llaeth trwy wneud y gwaith.  Roedd y berthynas rhwng y gweithwyr yn dda.   Â£1, 12 a 6 oedd ei chyflog cyntaf ac roedd yn rhoiâr rhan fwyaf ohono i'w mam. Roedd hi'n byw ym Modffordd ac yn mynd i'r ffatri yn Llangefni ar y bws. Ar un adeg roedd yn rhaid iddi weithio shifft nos, a phrynodd hi feic er mwyn cyrraedd y gwaith.  Yn y dechrau, roedd hi'n gweithio o naw tan bump, ond doedd hi ddim yn teimlo ei fod o'n diwrnod hir. Doedd dim cantÃ®n yno ond roedd cwtsh bach lle roedden nhw'n rhoi'u cotiau ac roedd bwrdd yno. Doedd dim tegell yno ac roedden nhw'n cynhesu dÅµr ar gyfer paned yn y lab. Yn 1966, diswyddodd y ffatri nifer o wragedd priod o achos diffyg llaeth, ac roedd yn  rhaid i Mair orffen yn y flwyddyn honno, a oedd yn dipyn o sioc, a chafodd hi ddim iawndal.  Yr arfer oedd 'first in last out' ond doedd hyn ddim wedi digwydd yn yr achos hwn, meddai.",

            "description": "Mair was a farmer's daughter, one of seven children, though the farm was sold after his death. Some of her sisters worked in a sewing factory. She left school at 16 to look for work, as coming from a large family it was necessary. She had wanted to be a nurse but she would have had to wait until she reached 19. She learned to type in the British School while looking for a job, and eventually got one in the milk factory, although she tried for work in the sewing factory too. This was in 1949 and she learned how to test the milk on the job. The relationship between the workers was good. Â£1 12 and 6 was her first wage and she gave most of it to her mother. She lived in Bodffordd and went to work on the bus. In the beginning she worked 9-5 but it didn't seem like a long day.  Later on she did nightshifts too and bought a bike to travel to work then. There wasn't a canteen there just a little cwtsh where they used to hang their coats. There wasn't even a kettle and they used to boil water for tea in the lab.  Mair worked there for 17 years until she lost her job in 1966 during a milk shortage, being a married woman with a husband to support her. It was supposed to be first in last out, she said, but not in her case. She was out of work for a while and it was awful, she said, signing on the dole, until she got another job.",
            "descriptionCy": "Ffermio oedd gwaith ei thad ac roedd Mair yn un o saith o blant.  Gwerthwyd fferm y teulu ar Ã´l marwolaeth ei thad.  Roedd rhai o'i chwiorydd yn gweithio mewn ffatri wnÃ¯o.  Aeth Mair i'r ysgol yn Llangefni, gan adael yn 16 oed, a chwilio am waith.   Eisiau bod yn nyrs yr oedd hi ond roedd yn rhaid aros tan iddi gyrraedd 19 oed. Dysgodd hi deipio yn y 'British School' traâi bod hi'n chwilio am swydd a chafodd hi swydd yn y ffatri llaeth, er ei bod hi'n trÃ¯o am swydd yn y ffatri wnÃ¯o hefyd.  Cafodd hi'r swydd ar Ã´l cael cyfweliad ac roedd hi'n teimlo'n hapus i gael swydd.  Yn 1949 yr oedd hynny a dysgodd hi sut i brofi llaeth trwy wneud y gwaith.  Roedd y berthynas rhwng y gweithwyr yn dda.   Â£1, 12 a 6 oedd ei chyflog cyntaf ac roedd yn rhoiâr rhan fwyaf ohono i'w mam. Roedd hi'n byw ym Modffordd ac yn mynd i'r ffatri yn Llangefni ar y bws. Ar un adeg roedd yn rhaid iddi weithio shifft nos, a phrynodd hi feic er mwyn cyrraedd y gwaith.  Yn y dechrau, roedd hi'n gweithio o naw tan bump, ond doedd hi ddim yn teimlo ei fod o'n diwrnod hir. Doedd dim cantÃ®n yno ond roedd cwtsh bach lle roedden nhw'n rhoi'u cotiau ac roedd bwrdd yno. Doedd dim tegell yno ac roedden nhw'n cynhesu dÅµr ar gyfer paned yn y lab. Yn 1966, diswyddodd y ffatri nifer o wragedd priod o achos diffyg llaeth, ac roedd yn  rhaid i Mair orffen yn y flwyddyn honno, a oedd yn dipyn o sioc, a chafodd hi ddim iawndal.  Yr arfer oedd 'first in last out' ond doedd hyn ddim wedi digwydd yn yr achos hwn, meddai.",

Born in Usk, Gwent, in 1823, his formal education ended when he left school at thirteen yet his interest in the natural world and insatiable desire to learn and discover propelled him to become one of the evolutionary thinkers of the nineteenth century and make enormous contributions to science and the development of evolutionary theory. \nHe co-published the theory of evolution by natural selection with Charles Darwin in 1858 and through his extensive explorations of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Amazon became the leading expert on the geographical distribution of species.",

            "description": "Olive was a nanny to Emlyn Hooson's children in London before returning to Carno and getting work in Laura Ashley in 1968.  There weren't many working there then, about 20, and the girls were sitting in two rows by their machines. She doesn't remember her first wage but said it was more than she was getting as a nanny as she lived in then. She remembers when piece work came in and how hard it was, and that she worked during her lunchtimes to make money. They also came in earlier in the mornings to catch up with the work. She started on hems first, moving on after she'd learned how to do that, onto the button and button hole machines and the overlocker. The work wasn't monotonous, she said, because there were different styles and different amounts of overlocking, some of the dresses needing a lot, but things like skirts not so much. She was a machinist until she left to have her first child in 1979. She thought about returning as a machinist but the piecework had become so fast that one of the girls said to her âOh, Olive, you'll never get your speed back up.â So she returned to Laura Ashley as a cleaner and later on worked in the canteen, serving food and cleaning until she retired in 2006",
            "descriptionCy": "Roedd Olive yn nani i blant Emlyn Hooson yn Llundain cyn dychwelyd i Garno a chael gwaith yn ffatri Laura Ashley yn 1968.   Doedd dim llawer yn gweithio yno ar y pryd, tuag ugain, ac roedd y merched yn eistedd mewn dwy res gyda'r peiriannau.   Dydy hi ddim yn cofio'i chyflog cyntaf ond roedd yn fwy nag oedd yr Hoosons yn ei dalu, gan ei bod hi'n byw yn eu tÅ·.   Mae'n cofio pan oedd hi ar 'piecework' ac roedd hynny'n galed ac roedd hi'n gweithio trwy amser cinio er mwyn gwneud pres.  Roedden nhw hefyd yn dod i mewn yn gynharach yn y bore er mwyn dal i fyny efo'r gwaith. Roedd hi wedi dechrau ar yr hemiau i ddechrau, symud ymlaen ar Ã´l dysgu sut i wneud hynna at waith arall a dysgu sut i wneud hwnnw. Doedd Olive ddim yn meddwl bod y gwaith yn undonog chwaith: âRoedd gwahanol steil a gwahanol faint o overlocio arno fo. Ar rai o'r  'wedding dresses' roeddech chi'n overlocio lot o ddarnau, ynde, ond ar fathau eraill, efallai doedd dim cymaint - pethau fel sgert.â Roedd hi yno fel peiriannydd tan iddi gael ei phlentyn cyntaf yn 1979. Roedd hi'n meddwl am fynd yn Ã´l fel peiriannydd ond roedd 'piecework' wedi mynd mor gyflym, a dywedodd un o'r merched wrthi: âOh, Olive, you'll never get your speed back up.â  Felly aeth hi'n Ã´l fel glanhawraig  yn y ffatri wedyn ac yn olaf bu'n gweithio yn y cantÃ®n, yn gwasanaethu a glanhau, tan iddi ymddeol yn 2006",

            "description": "In this letter, John writes that he is resting at the moment and not very busy.  He went to look for the lads from Wales yesterday and saw that Richard Owen was well but that Jonah Jones was ill again.\n\nThe men received two months pay on the eighteenth of the month but it's not safe to send money home in a letter at the moment.  He believes that when they reach Vicksburg, there will be better order.\n\nThe batteries opened on the enemy at four o'clock this morning and John has heard that General Logan is intending to attack a key fort today. He tells his parents that there is much noise and if he had been at home listening to this he would have believed that the world was coming to an end.\n\nHe also mentions that many of the Welsh lads from the 56th Ohio Infantry were killed or wounded in the battle of Champion Hill and he describes how the Ohios, together with the 29th Wisconsin and the 11th Indiana, attacked the rebels' batteries at Champion and captured the site.  However, following a counter attack, the rebels regained the battery, and the three regiments were sent from the field with the rebels chasing them.\n\n'the rebels were still coming forwards like butchers with their sleeves rolled up'.\n\nThe Union side had only two lines against seven and the battle was fierce until in the end the rebels yielded their ground.  According to John, about two thousand were taken prisoners.\n\nJohn also says that William Jones died some time ago.",

The vessel lies with its keel orientated 135/310 degrees with the bows to the southeast and a slight list to port. The remains consist of the keel, floors and first futtocks of a vessel which has the appearance of a sailing or tow barge being flat bottomed and having a rounded bow. The floors measure 6in (150mm) sided and 7.5in (190mm) moulded. The spacing of the floors is 14in (580mm). The spacing between floor and first futtock is 1.5in (40mm). The hull fastenings are ferrous and concreted. Basic dimensions comprise 60ft 9in (14.5m) from sternpost to the surviving remains of the rising curve of the inner stempost, and 14ft 9in (4.5m) to the turn of the bilge amidships. The inner stempost or apron has a curved forefoot. The outer stempost is missing, as evidenced by the keel extending beyond the apron. The keel appears to be sheathed in iron (concreted). The keel also extends beyond the sternpost to create the lower fixing point for the rudder. On the southern side (starboard) there are the remains of two length of chains with flattened links, which disappear into the mud (attached to the keel?). These chains are spaced approximately a quarter way along the vessel from the bow and stern (fore and aft). The bow has been strengthed with concrete between the riders. There is also evidence of concrete having been poured into the spaces between the deadwood/ keel and cant frames towards the stern. On the northern side of the wreck (port side), detail of the planking can be seen - lower strakes appear abutted to each other rather than scarfed and measure approximately 2in/60mm x 5in/120mm. The barge has at least three rubbing strakes fitted to its outer lower hull measuiring approximately 2in/50mm thick x 5in/120mm deep. To the southeast and nearer to the tide line on the island, there is a large upright timber which perhaps acted as a mooring post. To the northwest, at the base of the beach slopel, there are two substantial loose timbers which may be from this wreck, or may consist of the keel of another smaller vessel.",

He was an active member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and had a passion for developing a better understanding of the working of the earthâs magnetic fields.  The ROYAL CHARTER became a large magnetical experiment as, day by day, Scoresby made observations of the  deviations between all the compasses on board the ship to assess how proximity to the ship's iron hull and masts might cause the compasses to stop pointing to the true poles.\n\nFor most days, his journal also noted the longitude and latitude of the ship from the noon day sightings and calculations made by the sailing master.  It is from these positions that we can follow the progress of the ship on its round the world voyage. \n\nThe full text of Rev William Scoresby âJournal of a Voyage to Australia and around the World for Magnetical Researchâ is available by following this link:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/journalavoyaget00smitgoog\nThe voyage journal begins on page 173 of the .pdf.",

Although he won many races in Britain and across Europe, it is Arthur's final race, the Bordeaux to Paris race of 1896, that has won him lasting fame.  The race carried a large cash prize, and Arthur was first home to collect it.  However, it appears that he took a wrong turn on the route, and as a result he was forced to share the prize money with the second place rider.  This was to be the end of Arthur's career, he died two months later having contracted typhoid.",

Er iddo ennill llawer o rasys ym Mhrydain ac yn Ewrop, ei ras olaf, o Bordeaux i Baris, sydd wdi ei wneud yn enwog. Roedd arian mawr fel gwobr i enillydd y ras, ac Arthur a'i enillodd. Fodd bynnag, mae'n ymddangos iddo gymryd troad anghywir yn ystod y ras, ac fel canlyniad roedd yn rhaid iddo rannu'r wobr gyda'r seiclwr a ddaeth yn ail.

The Italians worked on local farms and some building projects. After their capture, they were replaced by German POWs who had spent time in the USA and were housed at Clatterbrune pending a return to their homeland. Several Italians and Germans chose to stay in the area after marrying local women. Thank you to George Lancett for sharing this photograph with us.</p>",

            "description": "This textbook by R. J. Berwyn (1836-1917) was written specifially to serve the educational needs of the children of the Welsh Settlement.  The first edition appeared in 1878 and a second edition, which included a number of additions, was published in 1881.  The book was designed with the assistance of Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel.  The textbook contains useful vocabulary, lessons, poems, proverbs and stories, as well as a list of Welsh children's names.  This was the first Welsh book to be published in Patagonia.    \n\nRichard  Jones (Berwyn) was born in Glyndyfrdwy, Merionethshire.  He lived for a while in London and the United States, but returned to Wales when he heard of the Rev. Michael D. Jones's plan to establish a Welsh settlement.  He adopted the name 'Berwyn' shortly after he emigrated to Patagonia in 1865. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was a writer and prominent figure in the history of the Welsh Settlement. He was the Settlement's first registrar of births, marriages and deaths, and was also responsible for editing its first Welsh newspaper, 'Y Brut' (1868).  He held a number of public posts, which included secretary of the governing Council, secretary of the Welsh courts, postmaster, and teacher.  With the assistance of Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel, he wrote a Welsh textbook designed to be used in the Settlement's schools, entitled 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; second edition, 1881).  He published his own series of almanacs annually until 1905. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was one of Lewis Jones's loyal supporters and they were bod imprisoned in 1882-3 for their part in the campaign to defend the rights of the Welsh.  Unfortunately, Berwyn's records and historical writings were lost during the floods of 1899.  He was the brother of William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn', who was also a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia.",
            "descriptionCy": "Cafodd y gwerslyfr hwn ei ysgrifennu yn arbennig at ddibenion addysgiadol plant y Wladfa gan R. J. Berwyn (1836-1917).  Cyhoeddwyd yr argraffiad cyntaf ym 1878 ac ymddangosodd yr ail argraffiad, a oedd yn cynnwys nifer o ychwanegiadau, ym 1881.  Lluniwyd y gyfrol gyda chymorth Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel.  Mae'r gwerslyfr yn cynnwys geirfa, gwersi, penillion, diarhebion a straeon, ynghyd Ã¢ rhestr o enwau Cymraeg i blant. Hwn oedd y llyfr Cymraeg cyntaf i gael ei argraffu yn y Wladfa.\n\nGaned Richard Jones (Berwyn) yng Nglyndyfrdwy, Sir Feirionnydd.  Treuliodd gyfnodau yn Llundain a'r Unol Daleithiau, ond dychwelodd i Gymru pan glywodd am gynllun y Parch. Michael D. Jones i sefydlu gwladfa Gymreig.  Mabwysiadodd yr enw 'Berwyn' yn fuan wedi iddo ymfudo i Batagonia ym 1865.  \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn llenor ac yn gymeriad blaenllaw yn hanes y Wladfa.  Ef oedd ei chofrestrydd genedigaethau, priodasau a marwolaethau, a bu hefyd yn gyfrifol am olygu papur newydd Cymraeg cyntaf y Wladfa, sef 'Y Brut' (1868).  Daliodd nifer o swyddi cyhoeddus, gan gynnwys ysgrifennydd Cyngor y Wladfa, ysgrifennydd y llysoedd Cymraeg, postfeistr, ac athro.  Gyda chymorth Thomas Pugh, lluniodd 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; ail argraffiad, 1881).  Cyhoeddwyd ei almanaciau yn flynyddol hyd 1905. \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn un o gefnogwyr teyrngar Lewis Jones a carcharwyd y ddau ohonynt ym 1882-3 am eu rhan yn yr ymgyrch i ddiogelu hawliau'r Cymry.  Yn anffodus, collwyd cofnodion a'i ysgrifau hanesyddol Berwyn yn llifogydd 1899.  Roedd yn frawd i William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn' a oedd hefyd yn byw yn y Wladfa.",

The names of the judges and jurors involved in different court cases are also listed.\n\nMost of the cases in this book relate to lesser crimes but it does contain some serious cases.  For example, on page 55 (image 29 of 80) a man named Louis de Pourier was found guilty of murdering a man named Charles Lymm.  It is noted that Louis de Pourier was to be handed over to the Argentine Government to be punished according to the Republic's laws.",

The water was clear and through the kelp and seaweeds of the shallow shore, catsharks and velvet swimming crabs appeared and scuttled away again concealing themselves among the rocks. Following a school of small silver fish, I came into a clear patch of water where the suns rays shined clear to the sand below. As I watched the fish, they suddenly turned in unison and darted to either side around me, and as they parted, suddenly, I was met face to face with a little diving bird, only a couple of feet away, who must have scattered the fish and who appeared just as surprised to see me as I was them. The little bird waited a moment, assessing, then with such powerful ease raced away through the water and it's sleek form and disappeared around a rock. At first, my mind thought it must be a penguin, maybe escaped from the zoo? Small, black and white colouring, and so clearly adapted to underwater hunting. The swim went on and the sun rose higher into the afternoon, finally, as I drifted back into the shore, the little bird appeared again, this time on the surface, regarding me calmly from a short distance away. After closer inspection, I could see it was a little Auk, floating alone and idly on the waves. The bird dipped and dived until eventually disappearing off around the coastline. I always think of that bird every time I go back to Anglesey and snorkel now, in awe of the ease of which it swam so fast and elegantly under the water, a privilege to see such a well adapted hunter in its natural environment, a rare sight indeed!

In the early days of the Settlement he was elected as one of the twelve members of a council which governed the Settlement. All his records were kept through the medium of Welsh.\n\nRichard  Jones (Berwyn) was born in Glyndyfrdwy, Merionethshire.  He lived for a while in London and the United States, but returned to Wales when he heard of the Rev. Michael D. Jones's plan to establish a Welsh settlement.  He adopted the name 'Berwyn' shortly after he emigrated to Patagonia in 1865. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was a writer and prominent figure in the history of the Welsh Settlement. He was the Settlement's first registrar of births, marriages and deaths, and was also responsible for editing its first Welsh newspaper, 'Y Brut' (1868).  He held a number of public posts, which included secretary of the governing Council, secretary of the Welsh courts, postmaster, and teacher.  With the assistance of Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel, he wrote a Welsh textbook designed to be used in the Settlement's schools, entitled 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; second edition, 1881).  He published his own series of almanacs annually until 1905. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was one of Lewis Jones's loyal supporters and they were bod imprisoned in 1882-3 for their part in the campaign to defend the rights of the Welsh.  Unfortunately, Berwyn's records and historical writings were lost during the floods of 1899.  He was the brother of William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn', who was also a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia.",
            "descriptionCy": "Cofnodion manwl a gadwyd gan R. J. Berwyn, Ysgrifennydd y Wladfa rhwng 1871 a 1872. Yn nyddiau cynnar yr ymsefydlu fe'i hetholwyd yn 1 o'r 12 aelod o'r cyngor i lywodraethu'r Wladfa ac ef oedd yr Ysgrifennydd. Cofnodai bopeth drwy gyfrwng y Gymraeg.\n\nGaned Richard Jones (Berwyn) yng Nglyndyfrdwy, Sir Feirionnydd.  Treuliodd gyfnodau yn Llundain a'r Unol Daleithiau, ond dychwelodd i Gymru pan glywodd am gynllun y Parch. Michael D. Jones i sefydlu gwladfa Gymreig.  Mabwysiadodd yr enw 'Berwyn' yn fuan wedi iddo ymfudo i Batagonia ym 1865.  \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn llenor ac yn gymeriad blaenllaw yn hanes y Wladfa.  Ef oedd ei chofrestrydd genedigaethau, priodasau a marwolaethau, a bu hefyd yn gyfrifol am olygu papur newydd Cymraeg cyntaf y Wladfa, sef 'Y Brut' (1868).  Daliodd nifer o swyddi cyhoeddus, gan gynnwys ysgrifennydd Cyngor y Wladfa, ysgrifennydd y llysoedd Cymraeg, postfeistr, ac athro.  Gyda chymorth Thomas Pugh, lluniodd 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; ail argraffiad, 1881).  Cyhoeddwyd ei almanaciau yn flynyddol hyd 1905. \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn un o gefnogwyr teyrngar Lewis Jones a carcharwyd y ddau ohonynt ym 1882-3 am eu rhan yn yr ymgyrch i ddiogelu hawliau'r Cymry.  Yn anffodus, collwyd cofnodion a'i ysgrifau hanesyddol Berwyn yn llifogydd 1899.  Roedd yn frawd i William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn' a oedd hefyd yn byw yn y Wladfa.",

            "description": "John Charles (1931-2004) was one of the greatest all round footballers.  He was comfortable playing centre-half or centre-forward and could also play full-back or midfield, if required.  Such was his versatility that he managed to break the Leeds United club scoring record with 42 goals in a season at a time when he was appearing at centre-half in internationals for Wales. \nHe made his debut  for Leeds in 1949 and within a year he had become the youngest player to appear for Wales when, in March 1950 at the age of 18 years and 71 days, he was capped against Northern Ireland. \nIn August 1957, Charles signed for Juventus for Â£65,000 - a record transfer fee for a British player.   He was the first Briton to make the grade in Italian football and is probably the most successful export from League football to Serie A where his name is still revered.   During Charles&#039;s five years with Juventus, they won three Serie A Championships and lifted the Italian Cup twice. \nHe came back to Wales in 1963, joining Cardiff City where he played until his retirement in 1966.  \nDuring his career, Charles earned 38 caps for Wales and will be rememberd as one of our greatest sportsmen.\n[Source: International Football Hall of Fame website (&lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"http://www.ifhof.com&quot;&gt;www.ifhof.com&lt;/a&gt;\">http://www.ifhof.com&quot;&gt;www.ifhof.com&lt;/a&gt;</a>, 20/11/2002)]",

Here, he discusses changes he has seen in the population of Atlantic grey seals around New Quay, Ceredigion, in the last 10 - 15 years.\nRecollection as follows:\n\"Then weâve got the seals. In-between Birds Rock and the Caves, the seals that used to haul out there â it was nothing to see 10 or 12 round there. But you are lucky to see 1 or 2 these days.  \nWhere have they gone? Have they left because of disturbance? \nBecause itâs not just the trip boats â at the same time as the wildlife trips have increased, there has been a huge increase in paddleboards and canoesâ¦a massive increase it has been! You can see them all parked down there in the racks.  Whereas we used to worry about the odd speedboat tearing around â when Bob Morris was around in the 80s, that was his concern then that there were more speedboats around then there used to be. He would jump up and down if he saw the disturbance from the number of paddleboards and canoes now. \nBut where have those seals gone â is it disturbance, is it the trip boats, is it the canoeists who love to go round to the rocks â because thatâs the first thing they want to do, go in and among the rocks â is the population dropping off, are they somewhere else, or are they not around anymore?  \nI think there has been quite a bit of tangle netting in the past few years, and I know they catch seals in the tangle nets â I know thatâs happening.\nWhy have we lost those animals that used to be there? Because theyâd tolerate Winston going past them all day long in the Catherine Harding. He would go past there, lift his pots, and go onâ¦heâd obviously scare a few off. But he did that for years, and we hadnât seen the drop in numbers that weâve got now.

He recalls encountering a group of common dolphins, whilst fishing at Manorbier Cove.\nRecollection as follows:\n\"A quiet evening fishing trip at Manorbier...I was using a handline to catch mackerel on feathers and suddenly, about 6 Common Dolphin surfaced next to me and just looked with playful interest. \n2-seconds later I had a huge tug on the line and bringing it in, found I had 4 large mackerel and 2 Pollock. No doubt the dolphins were there for the fish which must have been in a big shoal beneath me. \nI was only maybe 200m offshore at the time and was quite surprised to see the dolphins so close inshore as commons are usually thought of as a more offshore species.

In 2008, whilst surfing on Freshwater West Beach, Andy spotted an otter along the shoreline.\nRecollection as follows:\nâI'd gone on a Christmas day solo surf at Freshwater West, one of the best surfing beaches in Wales. Not surprisingly, with it being Christmas day itself, the beach was deserted and I had a couple of hours of peaceful, if cold, waves before paddling in. As I was being carried in by the white water close to the beach, I noticed what I thought was a dog trotting along the shoreline ahead of me, pretty much exactly where I was about to come to rest on the sand. I'm always a bit tense around unaccompanied dogs, especially in remote places so imagine my delight to find the dog was an otter!\nI think because I was flat on my board paddling in it just didn't recognise me as either a human or a threat so just carried on pottering about quite unconcerned, and I floated gently up to within a couple of metres then just lay completely still as it trotted past then off up the beach. \nGolden moment and a great Christmas present.â",

Didn't start watching regularly until the late 60s. Aberfan was poignant because a colleague came from Aberfan, she was at work when the news broke. The coverage conveyed the feeling in Aberfan because those reporting were obviously upset themselves. She watched the Investiture and remembers the fear that something would happen during the ceremony. Didn't think it was an affront to Wales but rather a recognition that Wales was separate. Doesn't remember much of the 79 Referendum but by 1997 was anxious for Yes vote. Didn't approve of government policy during the Miners' Strike and had sympathy with the miners. Coverage didn't portray the miners in a good light but because of her sympathies she could not judge.",

Ni wnaeth ddechrau gwylio'n rheolaidd nes diwedd y 60au.Roedd Aberfan yn ingol, gan fod cydweithiwr yn dod o Aberfan, roedd hi yn y gwaith pan glywodd y newyddion. Mi wnaeth y darlledu cyfleu'r teimlad yn Aberfan gan fod y sawl a oedd yn sylwebu yn amlwg wedi cael ysgytwad eu hunain. Gwyliodd yr Arwisgiad a chofia'r pryder y byddai rhywbeth yn digwydd yn ystod y seremoni. Nid oedd yn meddwl ei fod yn sarhad ar Gymru ond yn hytrach yn gydnabyddiaeth fod Cymru ar wahan. Nid yw'n cofio llawer am Refferendwm 79 ond erbyn 1997 roedd yn awyddus am bleidlais Ie. Nid oedd yn cymeradwyo polisi'r llywodraeth yn ystod Streic y Glowyr ac roedd yn cydymdeimlo a'r glowyr. Nid oedd y darlledu'n portreadu'r glowyr yn dda ond oherwydd ei chydymdeimlad ni fedrai farnu.",

This competition was launched by Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales during the COVID-19 lockdown period, to encourage creativity and digital skills while pupils were learning at home.</p><p>This museum was created by Thomas Silk in Year 2. Great work Thomas!</p><p>About Thomas&#39; museum: Thomas says that the museum is for everyone and he thinks people will enjoy visiting because of the space to learn but also relax in pretty surroundings. Thomas says that the most important piece in the collection is the Enderdragon Egg which is in a display case as you enter the museum. It is important because it is the most important block in the entire history of Minecraft. Thomas got his ideas for the layout and style from visits to St Fagans, Cardiff Museum and virtual visits to museums such as the Natural History Museum during lockdown.</p>",

He joined the lifeboat crew at Moelfre at the age of 16 in 1921 and, after two promotions to bowman and second coxswain, he was appointed coxswain in April 1954. Between 1921 and his retirement in 1970, the lifeboat was launched 179 times and 281 lives were saved. \n\nThe first of his medals was awarded for the rescue of eight men in October 1959, during which he brought the lifeboat alongside a shipwrecked motor vessel ten times in gales that reached 104mph.  The second medal was awarded for a rescue in winds reaching 127mph in December 1966. Coxswain Evans spent over twelve hours in extreme conditions in order to rescue ten men from a Greek motor vessel.\n\nRichard Evans was 'Man of the Year' in 1967 and was awarded the Medal of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for Meritorious Service (BEM) in 1969.\n\nThis statue of Richard Evans was made by sculptor Sam Holland.",

            "description": "Aerial photograph of Upper Bank Copperworks, Swansea, showing excavations from the north-west. Taken on 04 March 2008.\n\nSwansea was the world centre of copper smelting during the Industrial Revolution, but most of the physical structures of this great industry have long been demolished or hidden by later development. The Royal Commission investigated copperworks sites at the time of large-scale demolition and land reclamation in the 1960s, when much disappeared forever. During the 1980s it identified previously unrecognised remains and began research that led in 2000 to the publication of Copperopolis: the Early Industrial Landscapes of Swansea.\n\nA new housing development on brown-field land in 2007 and 2008 gave an exceptional opportunity to reveal the hidden heritage of the copper industry, at the site of the Upper Bank smelting works, established in 1755. The Commission had previously identified Swanseaâs last standing copper-smelting hall here and it advised that substantial remains of early furnaces would be found below ground. Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust accordingly requested an archaeological watching-brief during development. As the buildings were cleared all that was visible to Oxford Archaeology, the contractors employed by the developer, Barratts, were the concrete substructures of later buildings. However, when these were cut through they revealed something resembling a hidden city, consisting of numerous structures from the early copper and zinc works.\n\nOne of the Commissionâs aerial photographs taken in March 2008 showed a large area of the central part of the site uncovered. On the right, the quays along the River Tawe, paved with cast slag blocks, were where copper ore that came by sailing ship from Cornwall, Anglesey and Chile was stockpiled for distribution on radiating narrow-gauge railways. The most prominent features across the site are the nine furnaces dating from its conversion from copper to zinc smelting after 1890, each with four parallel gas flues. The three circular structures mid-way up the right-hand side produced gas to fuel them.\nAt the left-hand side towards the bottom are four pits (crossed by a concrete ramp) that were the bases of the earlier copper furnaces. Copper-smelting at Swansea was carried out by âthe Welsh methodâ, which involved successive roastings of ore â at least twenty of them. The reverbatory-type furnaces drew the heat through and reflected it off vaulted roofs, allowing the metal to be uncontaminated by the coal. Their stoking holes, the pits into which waste from each furnace was cleaned and the bases of chimneys all survived.\n\nRemains were also excavated of granulation pits where the molten copper from the furnaces was dropped into water so as to solidify as granules that were taken for further processing. Interlocking cast-iron barrowing planks were found: it is known from records that a woman labourer called Mrs Matthews barrowed 23 tons of copper ore in a single day here (she was said to be âtoo tired to attend chapelâ). At the centre of the site is the base of a large calcining furnace, marked by two oblongs and an archaeologist in a yellow jacket lying with arms and legs outstretched. This was where the initial drying and roasting of the ore took place. The contents were extracted through rectangular slots, the workers using long rakes and covering their mouths to reduce their exposure to the sulphur. Other sites in the Swansea valley may yet produce further significant remains of âCopperopolisâ.",

It stands outside the Calvinistic Methodist chapel in the town of Bala.  Thomas Charles was one of the most prominent leaders of the Methodist movement in Wales.  He settled in Bala in 1783 and is perhaps best known for his circulating Sunday school system and his role as one of the founders of the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804).  He was responsible for editing the Society's first Welsh Bible and up to his death in 1814 he published and distributed some 320,000 books to his scholars.",

On the ironworks site itself the conserved workers' housing of Stack Square survive on the south-east side.\nImportant sites within Blaenavon Town include: Blaenavon Ironworks, St Peter's School, St Peter's Church and the Worker's Institute.",

His philosophy was that an everyday natural and unstaged scene could make a brilliant photograph. He gave his photos titles and they were always tinged with humour and pathos as shown here. The club still awards a prize in his name. He had a studio in Canon Street in the town centre, above the old Leather Stores (now a branch of Halifax) and a dark room at his own home in Trevor Street, next door to where I lived, where he developed his photos.</p>",

To make it more real, two Syrian girls from the English school , dressed in their native costume, are seated, one at the head, the other at the foot of the receptacle for a body. We cannot say that this was the tomb of the rich Arimathean Joseph; but we can say that it stands in a hill which may have been Calvary; that it belongs to the Roman age; that it was hewn out of the rock that but one burial place in it was completed, although two others were left unfinished; and that the receptacle for the body was such that two people could be seated beside it, as the women found the two angels on that Easter morning. All these facts, with the added possibility that here may have rested the body of Jesus, gives to this place a surpassing interest.\" Original Format: Lantern slides Original Collection: Visual Instruction Department Lantern Slides Item Number: P217:set 013 037 Restrictions: Permission to use must be obtained from the OSU Archives.

And this recording is being collected as an oral history and will be part of the Chronicle Project, a project led by VCS Cymru and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.Â \nMH: Thanks Antionette. Could you just introduce yourself and just tell us how you first got involved in volunteering?\n[Early experience at BIT in London - 0:05 to 6:35]Â \nAL: Well, my name is Antoinette Lorraine. Um, I live in Cardiff. I haven't been far out of Cardiff, I went to London for a few years when I was quite young, and I did live in Holland for nine years, um, and then I returned to Cardiff.Â So how did I get involved in volunteering. Itâs oh, I was in London actually. I was, I was quite young yeah , I was about 18 and I went to live in London and I actually ended up having quite a good job in London, in Berkeley Square, at quite a young age.And in the evenings I went to help out at a project called BIT. Oh firstly, I remember now, firstly I went to help out at Simon Community for a little while, yeah I remember that now, that was a place for homeless people, alcoholics and, not that that equates necessarily but you know there were various types of people there.But I ended up somehow in BIT, I can't recall how I came to be in BIT. Um, I was quite impressed with BIT because it was a type of switchboard organisation, because you can imagine in London there were lots of people coming through from all over the world, and I remember it was in Ladbroke Grove, and how I helped is that I was quite good at administration, because that was my job during the day, and so I would sort of help the coordinator there, um, by typing up lots of reports that he had to do et cetera.Â So that's what I did, I, I don't recall why I got involved in volunteering, itâs quite a strange thing now that you ask me because I do know that at that age, like many people that age, I felt like I wanted to change the world and so it just seemed to be in my DNA.Â I think I was born, born wanting to do that and, yeah, and how I ended up in BIT I can't recall. But anyway I did that for the whole of the time I was in London. And um, so I met a lot of people there, saw a lot of things there. I remember that some of the, talking to some of the people there, and they were a little bit bitter about the way things were in society, and I remember being accused of, oh you're coming here, you just want to paper over the cracks.Â But anyway I was young, what could I, what could I do, what could I know, I just did a bit there. Um, and so that's how it started, and I actually did return to Cardiff. [Setting up RIB (Rights and Information Bureau) in Cardiff] And again I can't recall how I ended up being involved with RIB.Â I know that I went to the student union and I was thinking about this, I think I must have asked for a meeting with someone in the student union. Maybe I suggested that they be involved in something like BIT in Cardiff. And I think that's how it might have come, come to be because I've tried to think about it and I, I just can't think of any other way that would have happened.Â And there was a man called Dave Smith and he was, yeah he was involved with the student union and so I had meetings together with him and, um, he got this building in Charles Street, 58 Charles Street, at a peppercorn rent and actually installed me in it really. And that's how it started.Â And it was meant to be a project similar to, to BIT, but of course Cardiff, it was very different to London, absolutely, but never the less we were there and, um, we had, um, yeah I don't know it just all started once we were there and we had volunteers came to, to help. And we had like an open door policy.Â What I do remember is that over the years that RIB, which was Rights and Information Bureau, were in existence, we did various things, it depended on who came to volunteer, you know what we could do or what we could offer.Â But certainly it was an open door policy so we would get people who would come and sit in there, um, yeah sometimes it was people, you know, who were in really dire straits or just like somewhere to come and sit for a while. And we were an information service primarily so if people called to ask various information then we would do our best to give them the information.Â I think we saw it as a place where, for people who wouldn't go to the establishment, you know, to the council offices, that they could come to us, we were like an intermediary. Um, a lot of things went on there, you know, when I look back now it surprises me because I am thinking oh yeah, a lot of people came through the place, came in to, in to help and to offer help and yeah just volunteer and give time.Â \n[The cook at RIB - 6:37 to 7:10]\nWe ended up one-time there with a little, someone, actually I remember him well, someone who had sat there for days on end, weeks on end, months on end, you know, and then he ended up doing, because we had two rooms, he ended up doing a little kitchen in one of the rooms, just making soup, and then people from outside, I remember, people like Pete Raymond from the Welsh National Opera and other people like that came in and had lunch there.Â \n[RIB funding and activities - 7:13 to 10:35]Â \nYeah, I know that the only way that we could fund ourselves was to have things like jumble sales and in those days jumble sales, they were very big, you know you could earn a lot of money having jumble sale in those days. And we also had benefit concerts, we had bands like Brinsley Schwarz and Black Sabbath and Hawkwind and Deep Purple and they actually came and did concerts for us to raise funds.Â I also know, remember that we did some placements, sometimes some social workers came to do some placements there because, you know, I can't totally pinpoint what it is we did, you know, but obviously for them it was very useful, for them to come to a place like that and to see what was happening on, you know, grassroots level, the type of things that people were going through, and you know some people who just can't, you know they just fall into a circumstance where it is really difficult for them to get out of it.Â I mean we gave advice on, well, whatever. I was thinking, I don't think we gave benefits advice, because we didn't have training sessions in things like that, but we would point people in the right direction to where they could get advice, you know. I'm trying to think of what else because we were very busy, we were open from I think 10 in the morning until 10 at night, so we had to have like a rota of volunteers who were there.Â We also set up like a, we called it a crash pad list, where people who were passing through Cardiff needed somewhere to stay, you know travellers or something, we could phone someone on the list and ask them if they would, um, put up someone for that night, and it was amazing how many people were on the list, you know, who were willing, and I remember we had people, some of them Americans who, you know, were very upset and a bit traumatised because they had been involved in Vietnam, things like that, you know.Â Yeah, and we had, I remember, I think some of the things that really stick in my mind is some of the characters who came in. And I'm sure that it was, what's the word, a foundation for some of the characters who just came in and sat there, I think it was like home to some of them, I mean we couldn't have loads of people coming in to sit there, it didn't work like that anyway but there were some regulars, you know, that came in and, yeah, just maybe it was a little bit of a haven for them, I don't know. [Laughs]Â \n[The cook again - 10:36 to 11:56]Â \nAnd I always remember one, I mean, it was really quite a funny occurrence because, I don't really know who he was and he just sat there, it was the one who set up the cafe in the end, but he sat there for months on end, he didn't say a word to anyone, and then I remember we needed some more volunteers and weâd advertised, and we had, we were like interviewing people to see if they would beâ¦it would work for them to be there, because some people were coming from other cities as well, and I remember just talking, mentioning to my colleague about one person, and this man who had just sat there piped up and said , âYes but would he have the personalityâ. [Laughs]Â And I just remember going into hysterical laughter because that was probably the only thing he said for the whole of the months, so he had been taking everything in, watching everything, and listening to everything. But anyway that was, yeah I mean I just look at this photograph, and you know I can see that there was plenty going on there but I can't remember it all, not all of it anyway. Butâ¦\nMH: Can you tell me about the photograph, you know, how that came about?Â \n[Description of the photograph - 12:01 to 13:32]\nAL: Yeah, the photograph was, this was taken by someone, actually it was Paul Harrison and heâd come, he was working for the Western Mail at the time, and he came to do an article about RIB for the paper, and he took the photograph.Â Actually, I had become friends with him and his wife, because they moved to live in London and he became an author and, um, and they were very interested in what we were doing there and I remember that we were about to do a, we were helping to go around Cardiff, you know counting, seeing how many homeless people there were and we were part of, helping with that project, and so I remember that he came with his wife, and he accompanied us all around Cardiff at that time, looking for homeless people to try to gauge how many people were , you know, sleeping rough in Cardiff.Â Yeah, so, but many people came through the doors, you know, in and out, yeah, and so it was a bit like a switchboard in a way, pointing people to appropriate places and um yeah. A lot of peopleâ¦ \n[Break in recording]Â \nMH: Could you just clarify what was the role of volunteers here, and also how you survived during the time you were with RIB?\n[Role of volunteers at RIB - 13:34 to 16:25]\nAL: Yeah, if I remember rightly, I earned about five pounds a week, if that, mainly we had benefit concerts, people like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Hawkwind, Brinsley Schwarz, they did benefit concerts for us, and also we had jumble sales, because in those days there were lots of jumble sales and there were queues to go to jumble sales, and we could earn, you know, money doing jumble sales.Â But, yeah, I suppose, when I think back it sounds ridiculous, but money didn't seem very important to me then, and people were very, very kind, generous and helpful to me because a lot of people knew I was there, working for not much at all, and for instance you can see on the photograph, this girl here Liz who was a volunteer, she came out of one of her, of her flat, sorry, and I moved into it, and it was absolutely cheap.Â I mean it just shows how times have changed, everything was so, so much, so different then. You could survive on not much money then. So I moved into her flat and it was really, really cheap, but a good flat. And, yeah, you know, you had the open air fruit market, you could go down there looking for cheap fruit and vegetables and things, we just lived differently then, and it was possible, I don't know if you could do it now really, but you know that was how I survived, but it didn't feel like surviving.Â I suppose I, yeah, wasn't someone who came out of school, I did work in an office, as I said I worked in an office in London when I was there, but I sort of started and stopped, gave it up quite quickly. In that moment I couldn't see myself doing that forever, being an office worker, but anyway. And volunteering, yeah we, there were always people who wanted to volunteer, who wanted to come in and help in some way or another, so it was, in a way it was quite a creative process because different volunteers had different ideas or different skills, and so lots of things went on there.Â \n[Stress - 16:28 to 17:52]Â \nI think, you know, for me eventually when Iâ¦ I can only see the positive side of it now, but when I look back I can also see that it was quite trying to work in a place like that, because yes you are seeing everything on the grassroots level with people who couldn't manage or cope with their lives for what ever reason and, um, this was around us all day, evening, every day, and so there was, it was all so stressful.Â And sometimes the stress could come from the people who volunteered, because of group dynamics, you know, we had, you can imagine, we had meetings every week and meetings are not always easy. But our basic idea, the basic idea was there to, we were a switchboard basically, that was the basis of it, to give information to people who wouldn't otherwise have access to information and that's what we did and everything else around it, you know you're going to get in whatever organisation youâre in.Â \nMH: What impact do you think your volunteering, or the activity of you and your volunteers there, had on wider society?\n[Impact of volunteering on the wider community - 18:03 to 20:27]\nAL: Oh gosh, I don't know what impact we had on wider society. I like to think that some of the people who came in there, whether they came for help or whether they came to volunteer, or just came to see what was going on and hang around there to see if they could do anything, I would like to think that it stayed inside of them for all of their lives, you know, and also some of the social work placements who came there.Â I know that one of them, I heard that he heard a negative comment when he was in a training, and he was able to defend, you know, the project. Because you can imagine certain people in establishment had their own ideas about what we did there, you know, I couldn't help everyone who came in there, you know it was the day and age, but I know that this particular man, he stood up for us, he defended us, you know, he obviously, he had done a placement there, and he had obviously got a lot from it and saw that we were trying to do our best in the circumstances.Â Yeah, so and also I understand that at the very least, the project, there were different projects that continued in that building, so that was a good thing in itself, you know. I think these type of projects are difficult to quantify, you know, that it's sometimes difficult to put a worth or a value and an awareness on the number of people that benefited, in a way.Â But I think a lot of people who came in there did benefit, and I would say, I may be wrong, but my opinion is that, especially some of the people who came in and were regulars coming in there because I think they were respected, and valued and yeah, I think so.Â \nMH: What do you think volunteering gave you personally?Â \n[Volunteering on personal life - 20:33 to 23:18]\nAL: Yeah, um, God, that's an interesting question isn't it. You asked me earlier, did I do any other volunteering work and, do you know what, I think I am almost still doing it, you won't believe this, the work I do now, when I went to live in Holland it was just like a miracle because I wanted to earn my living doing this work I do now which is stimulating potential through music and movement, and a group situation, and there what I do became my absolute full-time work, I mean I was doing it with the police academy, Genesis Consulting, weekly groups of 50 or 60 people.Â But I came back to UK, and it has taken ages to get it going again, you know my international work goes, but here you could say I go to groups and I do it basically free of cost because I donât get enough people. But the point is, I love doing what I do and I say, if I get one person, it's worth it.Â So I was thinking that, to a certain extent, [laughs] some of my other work has to fund what I do here, because Iâve brought this thing here, there were not many teachers here, there still aren't many teachers here, but I believe in it and so I do it even though I don't get much money here doing it.Â So in that respect, you know, so what it leads me then to think is that obviously I get something from it, don't I. I get something from that, but, you know, Iâd only, my only wish would be that every single person in the whole world would be in a similar situation, that they would get something, and feel something good, from doing something for someone else.Â That would be my desire because I don't think the world would be in the state it's in if everyone felt good when they helped someone else, you know, or when they did something for someone else, you know. So, but I'm only saying that maybe it was something in me that, clearly it was something in me that wanted toâ¦ I think that a lot of people feel that in the teenage years, isnât it, they want to save the world, they think they can, but not everyone, maybe if everyone did it could happen, but a lot of people do I think, during that time, but it's in my DNA I think. [Laughs]Â \nMH: In a nutshell, what does volunteering mean for you?Â \n[Definitions of volunteering - 23:26 to 25:23]\nAL: Right okay, I wish there was no need for anyone to volunteer, to do anything, okay that's the first thing. I feel quite radical in that I don't believe there should be the need for volunteers, because I think we have a government that should be the protectors and the safety net of the people and I know that in some countries that does exist, like in places like Denmark and Finland, the governments make sure that everyone, and the Netherlands too, make sure that people are happy and have the circumstances to flourish, safety nets.Â In our culture, we don't have that type of system, so itâs necessary then to have volunteers, we have to have volunteers. But I don't believe that in a really true, you know, good, proper working culture that there would be a need for volunteers, in my opinion, there should not be the need, nor for charities neither.Â I think why, when we have a government who is there to serve the people, protect the people, make safety nets for everyone. We should only really be in a situation in life of, well now how am I going to flourish my potentials, how am I going to grow myself as a human being, you shouldn't have to worry about all the âwhere I going to get the next thing to pay my rent, where am I going to get the next thingâ, you know, people canât flourish when theyâre, so then we do need theâ¦we have do the work that the government is supposed to be doing, because you can't just let people, you know, sort of suffer.Â \nMH: Thank you very much, Antoinette. Thank you.Â \n[Note: later that day the following was received in an email from Antoinette]Â \n\"One more point: I donât think itâs to feel good that I volunteered (it was stressful) it is more to do something that I feel is worthwhile (of course this is still for myself so that is what I meant). And this will be according to my own personal values for my life. -Antoinette",

I was, I was quite young yeah , I was about 18 and I went to live in London and I actually ended up having quite a good job in London, in Berkeley Square, at quite a young age.And in the evenings I went to help out at a project called BIT. Oh firstly, I remember now, firstly I went to help out at Simon Community for a little while, yeah I remember that now, that was a place for homeless people, alcoholics and, not that that equates necessarily but you know there were various types of people there.But I ended up somehow in BIT, I can't recall how I came to be in BIT. Um, I was quite impressed with BIT because it was a type of switchboard organisation, because you can imagine in London there were lots of people coming through from all over the world, and I remember it was in Ladbroke Grove, and how I helped is that I was quite good at administration, because that was my job during the day, and so I would sort of help the coordinator there, um, by typing up lots of reports that he had to do et cetera.Â So that's what I did, I, I don't recall why I got involved in volunteering, itâs quite a strange thing now that you ask me because I do know that at that age, like many people that age, I felt like I wanted to change the world and so it just seemed to be in my DNA.Â I think I was born, born wanting to do that and, yeah, and how I ended up in BIT I can't recall. But anyway I did that for the whole of the time I was in London. And um, so I met a lot of people there, saw a lot of things there. I remember that some of the, talking to some of the people there, and they were a little bit bitter about the way things were in society, and I remember being accused of, oh you're coming here, you just want to paper over the cracks.Â But anyway I was young, what could I, what could I do, what could I know, I just did a bit there. Um, and so that's how it started, and I actually did return to Cardiff. [Setting up RIB (Rights and Information Bureau) in Cardiff] And again I can't recall how I ended up being involved with RIB.Â I know that I went to the student union and I was thinking about this, I think I must have asked for a meeting with someone in the student union. Maybe I suggested that they be involved in something like BIT in Cardiff. And I think that's how it might have come, come to be because I've tried to think about it and I, I just can't think of any other way that would have happened.Â And there was a man called Dave Smith and he was, yeah he was involved with the student union and so I had meetings together with him and, um, he got this building in Charles Street, 58 Charles Street, at a peppercorn rent and actually installed me in it really. And that's how it started.Â And it was meant to be a project similar to, to BIT, but of course Cardiff, it was very different to London, absolutely, but never the less we were there and, um, we had, um, yeah I don't know it just all started once we were there and we had volunteers came to, to help. And we had like an open door policy.Â What I do remember is that over the years that RIB, which was Rights and Information Bureau, were in existence, we did various things, it depended on who came to volunteer, you know what we could do or what we could offer.Â But certainly it was an open door policy so we would get people who would come and sit in there, um, yeah sometimes it was people, you know, who were in really dire straits or just like somewhere to come and sit for a while. And we were an information service primarily so if people called to ask various information then we would do our best to give them the information.Â I think we saw it as a place where, for people who wouldn't go to the establishment, you know, to the council offices, that they could come to us, we were like an intermediary. Um, a lot of things went on there, you know, when I look back now it surprises me because I am thinking oh yeah, a lot of people came through the place, came in to, in to help and to offer help and yeah just volunteer and give time.Â [The cook at RIB - 6:37 to 7:10]Â We ended up one-time there with a little, someone, actually I remember him well, someone who had sat there for days on end, weeks on end, months on end, you know, and then he ended up doing, because we had two rooms, he ended up doing a little kitchen in one of the rooms, just making soup, and then people from outside, I remember, people like Pete Raymond from the Welsh National Opera and other people like that came in and had lunch there.Â [RIB funding and activities - 7:13 to 10:35]Â Yeah, I know that the only way that we could fund ourselves was to have things like jumble sales and in those days jumble sales, they were very big, you know you could earn a lot of money having jumble sale in those days. And we also had benefit concerts, we had bands like Brinsley Schwarz and Black Sabbath and Hawkwind and Deep Purple and they actually came and did concerts for us to raise funds.Â I also know, remember that we did some placements, sometimes some social workers came to do some placements there because, you know, I can't totally pinpoint what it is we did, you know, but obviously for them it was very useful, for them to come to a place like that and to see what was happening on, you know, grassroots level, the type of things that people were going through, and you know some people who just can't, you know they just fall into a circumstance where it is really difficult for them to get out of it.Â I mean we gave advice on, well, whatever. I was thinking, I don't think we gave benefits advice, because we didn't have training sessions in things like that, but we would point people in the right direction to where they could get advice, you know. I'm trying to think of what else because we were very busy, we were open from I think 10 in the morning until 10 at night, so we had to have like a rota of volunteers who were there.Â We also set up like a, we called it a crash pad list, where people who were passing through Cardiff needed somewhere to stay, you know travellers or something, we could phone someone on the list and ask them if they would, um, put up someone for that night, and it was amazing how many people were on the list, you know, who were willing, and I remember we had people, some of them Americans who, you know, were very upset and a bit traumatised because they had been involved in Vietnam, things like that, you know.Â Yeah, and we had, I remember, I think some of the things that really stick in my mind is some of the characters who came in. And I'm sure that it was, what's the word, a foundation for some of the characters who just came in and sat there, I think it was like home to some of them, I mean we couldn't have loads of people coming in to sit there, it didn't work like that anyway but there were some regulars, you know, that came in and, yeah, just maybe it was a little bit of a haven for them, I don't know. [Laughs]Â [The cook again - 10:36 to 11:56]Â And I always remember one, I mean, it was really quite a funny occurrence because, I don't really know who he was and he just sat there, it was the one who set up the cafe in the end, but he sat there for months on end, he didn't say a word to anyone, and then I remember we needed some more volunteers and weâd advertised, and we had, we were like interviewing people to see if they would beâ¦it would work for them to be there, because some people were coming from other cities as well, and I remember just talking, mentioning to my colleague about one person, and this man who had just sat there piped up and said , âYes but would he have the personalityâ. [Laughs]Â And I just remember going into hysterical laughter because that was probably the only thing he said for the whole of the months, so he had been taking everything in, watching everything, and listening to everything. But anyway that was, yeah I mean I just look at this photograph, and you know I can see that there was plenty going on there but I can't remember it all, not all of it anyway. Butâ¦MH: Can you tell me about the photograph, you know, how that came about?Â [Description of the photograph - 12:01 to 13:32]AL: Yeah, the photograph was, this was taken by someone, actually it was Paul Harrison and heâd come, he was working for the Western Mail at the time, and he came to do an article about RIB for the paper, and he took the photograph.Â Actually, I had become friends with him and his wife, because they moved to live in London and he became an author and, um, and they were very interested in what we were doing there and I remember that we were about to do a, we were helping to go around Cardiff, you know counting, seeing how many homeless people there were and we were part of, helping with that project, and so I remember that he came with his wife, and he accompanied us all around Cardiff at that time, looking for homeless people to try to gauge how many people were , you know, sleeping rough in Cardiff.Â Yeah, so, but many people came through the doors, you know, in and out, yeah, and so it was a bit like a switchboard in a way, pointing people to appropriate places and um yeah. A lot of peopleâ¦ [Break in recording]Â MH: Could you just clarify what was the role of volunteers here, and also how you survived during the time you were with RIB?[Role of volunteers at RIB - 13:34 to 16:25]AL: Yeah, if I remember rightly, I earned about five pounds a week, if that, mainly we had benefit concerts, people like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Hawkwind, Brinsley Schwarz, they did benefit concerts for us, and also we had jumble sales, because in those days there were lots of jumble sales and there were queues to go to jumble sales, and we could earn, you know, money doing jumble sales.Â But, yeah, I suppose, when I think back it sounds ridiculous, but money didn't seem very important to me then, and people were very, very kind, generous and helpful to me because a lot of people knew I was there, working for not much at all, and for instance you can see on the photograph, this girl here Liz who was a volunteer, she came out of one of her, of her flat, sorry, and I moved into it, and it was absolutely cheap.Â I mean it just shows how times have changed, everything was so, so much, so different then. You could survive on not much money then. So I moved into her flat and it was really, really cheap, but a good flat. And, yeah, you know, you had the open air fruit market, you could go down there looking for cheap fruit and vegetables and things, we just lived differently then, and it was possible, I don't know if you could do it now really, but you know that was how I survived, but it didn't feel like surviving.Â I suppose I, yeah, wasn't someone who came out of school, I did work in an office, as I said I worked in an office in London when I was there, but I sort of started and stopped, gave it up quite quickly. In that moment I couldn't see myself doing that forever, being an office worker, but anyway. And volunteering, yeah we, there were always people who wanted to volunteer, who wanted to come in and help in some way or another, so it was, in a way it was quite a creative process because different volunteers had different ideas or different skills, and so lots of things went on there.Â [Stress - 16:28 to 17:52]Â I think, you know, for me eventually when Iâ¦ I can only see the positive side of it now, but when I look back I can also see that it was quite trying to work in a place like that, because yes you are seeing everything on the grassroots level with people who couldn't manage or cope with their lives for what ever reason and, um, this was around us all day, evening, every day, and so there was, it was all so stressful.Â And sometimes the stress could come from the people who volunteered, because of group dynamics, you know, we had, you can imagine, we had meetings every week and meetings are not always easy. But our basic idea, the basic idea was there to, we were a switchboard basically, that was the basis of it, to give information to people who wouldn't otherwise have access to information and that's what we did and everything else around it, you know you're going to get in whatever organisation youâre in.Â MH: What impact do you think your volunteering, or the activity of you and your volunteers there, had on wider society?Â [Impact of volunteering on the wider community - 18:03 to 20:27]AL: Oh gosh, I don't know what impact we had on wider society. I like to think that some of the people who came in there, whether they came for help or whether they came to volunteer, or just came to see what was going on and hang around there to see if they could do anything, I would like to think that it stayed inside of them for all of their lives, you know, and also some of the social work placements who came there.Â I know that one of them, I heard that he heard a negative comment when he was in a training, and he was able to defend, you know, the project. Because you can imagine certain people in establishment had their own ideas about what we did there, you know, I couldn't help everyone who came in there, you know it was the day and age, but I know that this particular man, he stood up for us, he defended us, you know, he obviously, he had done a placement there, and he had obviously got a lot from it and saw that we were trying to do our best in the circumstances.Â Yeah, so and also I understand that at the very least, the project, there were different projects that continued in that building, so that was a good thing in itself, you know. I think these type of projects are difficult to quantify, you know, that it's sometimes difficult to put a worth or a value and an awareness on the number of people that benefited, in a way.Â But I think a lot of people who came in there did benefit, and I would say, I may be wrong, but my opinion is that, especially some of the people who came in and were regulars coming in there because I think they were respected, and valued and yeah, I think so.Â MH: What do you think volunteering gave you personally?Â [Volunteering on personal life - 20:33 to 23:18]AL: Yeah, um, God, that's an interesting question isn't it. You asked me earlier, did I do any other volunteering work and, do you know what, I think I am almost still doing it, you won't believe this, the work I do now, when I went to live in Holland it was just like a miracle because I wanted to earn my living doing this work I do now which is stimulating potential through music and movement, and a group situation, and there what I do became my absolute full-time work, I mean I was doing it with the police academy, Genesis Consulting, weekly groups of 50 or 60 people.Â But I came back to UK, and it has taken ages to get it going again, you know my international work goes, but here you could say I go to groups and I do it basically free of cost because I donât get enough people. But the point is, I love doing what I do and I say, if I get one person, it's worth it.Â So I was thinking that, to a certain extent, [laughs] some of my other work has to fund what I do here, because Iâve brought this thing here, there were not many teachers here, there still aren't many teachers here, but I believe in it and so I do it even though I don't get much money here doing it.Â So in that respect, you know, so what it leads me then to think is that obviously I get something from it, don't I. I get something from that, but, you know, Iâd only, my only wish would be that every single person in the whole world would be in a similar situation, that they would get something, and feel something good, from doing something for someone else.Â That would be my desire because I don't think the world would be in the state it's in if everyone felt good when they helped someone else, you know, or when they did something for someone else, you know. So, but I'm only saying that maybe it was something in me that, clearly it was something in me that wanted toâ¦ I think that a lot of people feel that in the teenage years, isnât it, they want to save the world, they think they can, but not everyone, maybe if everyone did it could happen, but a lot of people do I think, during that time, but it's in my DNA I think. [Laughs]Â MH: In a nutshell, what does volunteering mean for you?Â [Definitions of volunteering - 23:26 to 25:23]AL: Right okay, I wish there was no need for anyone to volunteer, to do anything, okay that's the first thing. I feel quite radical in that I don't believe there should be the need for volunteers, because I think we have a government that should be the protectors and the safety net of the people and I know that in some countries that does exist, like in places like Denmark and Finland, the governments make sure that everyone, and the Netherlands too, make sure that people are happy and have the circumstances to flourish, safety nets.Â In our culture, we don't have that type of system, so itâs necessary then to have volunteers, we have to have volunteers. But I don't believe that in a really true, you know, good, proper working culture that there would be a need for volunteers, in my opinion, there should not be the need, nor for charities neither.Â I think why, when we have a government who is there to serve the people, protect the people, make safety nets for everyone. We should only really be in a situation in life of, well now how am I going to flourish my potentials, how am I going to grow myself as a human being, you shouldn't have to worry about all the âwhere I going to get the next thing to pay my rent, where am I going to get the next thingâ, you know, people canât flourish when theyâre, so then we do need theâ¦we have do the work that the government is supposed to be doing, because you can't just let people, you know, sort of suffer.Â MH: Thank you very much, Antoinette. Thank you.Â [Note: later that day the following was received in an email from Antoinette]Â \"One more point: I donât think itâs to feel good that I volunteered (it was stressful) it is more to do something that I feel is worthwhile (of course this is still for myself so that is what I meant). And this will be according to my own personal values for my life. -Antoinette",

It is an example of multi-level, mixed-use development with shops, supermarket, public house, etc. set around a court and integrated with low and high rise residential units.\n\"I remember that when this [Ringland Centre] was built in 1966, it had fountains in the middle of it; they've been concreted over - too expensive to maintain, too many frolicking children - and now youngsters are performing wheelies where they once stood. Maybe one day they'll come back, along with the idea that a large community of not very wealthy working-class people should live in pleasant, uplifting surroundings\".Stephen Moss, The Guardian, Sept 2010.

Kyffin Williams worked as an art teacher in London for years before becoming known as an artist. A key turning point in his life was his visit to Patagonia in 1968, and soon after that he decided to return to Anglesey where he spent the rest of his life depicting the landscapes and people of his native region. He was a generous benefactor to the arts in Wales, and bequeathed a splendid collection of his work to the National Library.",

            "description": "Peniel Chapel is located at the southern gateway of the planned town of Tremadog. Its innovative gable front and auditorium plan proved highly influential in the evolution of Welsh chapel design whilst its pedimented portico with Tuscan columns has made it one of Walesâ most iconic chapels. Tremadog was the project of London entrepreneur, William Madocks, who bought the marsh land in 1798 and envisioned it as a settlement on the trade route between London and Ireland.  The Calvinist Methodist chapel was finished in 1810, and when enlarged in 1849 to the original designs, it was possibly the most striking chapel in Wales, its temple front loosely based on Inigo Jonesâ St Paulâs, Covent Garden.\n\nMadocks himself was not a dissenter, so his allowing a chapel within the town was a shock to some. However Madocks was not threatened by the idea of such a large chapel being built, observing that âthe church is built on rocks, the chapel is built on sand.â The opening ceremony was presided over by influential Welsh preacher, Rev.Thomas Charles of Bala. As the congregation increased, the pews were replaced in 1860, the galleries extended in 1880, and the pulpit renewed in 1898. Following its closure, it was acquired by Addoldai Cymru in 2010, and its schoolroom houses the Trustâs main office.",
            "descriptionCy": "Saif Capel Peniel ym mhorth deheuol tref gynlluniedig Tremadog. Roedd ei gynllun blaen talcen ac awditoriwm arloesol yn hynod o ddylanwadol yn esblygiad dyluniad capeli Cymru ac mae ei bortico pedimentog gyda cholofnau Tysganaidd yn ei wneud yn un o gapeli mwyaf eiconig Cymru.\n\nProsiect entrepreneur o Lundain, William Madocks, oedd Tremadog. Prynodd hwnnwâr corstir yn 1798 gan feddwl sefydlu tref ar y llwybr masnach rhwng Llundain ac Iwerddon. Cwblhawyd y capel Methodistaidd yn 1810, a phan gafodd ei helaethu yn 1849 yn unol Ã¢âr dyluniadau gwreiddiol, maeân bosib mai hwn oedd y capel mwyaf trawiadol yng Nghymru, aâi du blaen temlaidd wediâi seilioân llac ar eglwys St Paul Inigo Jones yn Covent Garden. Nid oedd Madocks ei hun yn anghydffurfiwr, felly sioc i rai oedd iddo ganiatÃ¡u capel yn y dref. Ond nid oedd Madocks yn gweld bygythiad yn y syniad o godi capel mor fawr, gan nodi bod âyr eglwys wediâi hadeiladu ar graig, aâr capel wediâi adeiladu ar dywodâ. Llywyddwyd dros y seremoni agoriadol gan y pregethwr dylanwadol, y Parch. Thomas Charles oâr Bala.\n\nWrth iâr gynulleidfa gynyddu, gosodwyd seddau newydd yn 1860, ehanguâr galerÃ¯au yn 1880, ac adnewydduâr pulpud yn 1898. Wedi cauâr capel, feâi prynwyd gan Addoldai Cymru yn 2010, ac mae prif swyddfaâr Ymddiriedolaeth yn ei ysgoldy.",

She worked in a shop before going to work in the Tick Tock factory from 1955 until 1980, when the factory closed. She had to pass an eye-test to get the job, because making the watches was such intricate work. The factory was homely because they spoke Welsh. They weren&#39;t allowed to speak when at work, but they did sing. She mentions the union and striking because of the heat and long hours. She describes teasing the men at Christmas, and the new apprentices; the Miss Tick Tock competition and the social life.</p>",

During the war she worked in Morris Motors &ndash; every factory had to employ one disabled worker per 100 able. She had a weak arm. It was good money (c. 1940) &ndash; pocket money from it. The work on the car and aeroplane radiators was heavy. Since a labourer had to help her she was paid less. There was a fuss when the Union started &ndash; she paid a groat but anonymously. She remembers the girls buying goods from catalogues. She refused to move to harder work &ndash; by showing her disabled card. Bruising from handling the radiator blocks. It was a noisy factory which has affected her hearing. Lots of joking and singing. She went on holiday with the girls, fun at Xmas. During the war, stars from the entertainment world visited. She got married (1953) &ndash; received a clock as a present. She left c.1981.</p>",

            "description": "Aerial photograph of an aerial bombing target for RAF Brawdy on Trevallen Downs, St Govan's Head. Taken on 30 July 2007.\n\nConcentric, circular aerial bombing target, part of a range utilised by RAF Brawdy. It comprises of three concentric circles of dry stone marked out on the ground and is mostly intact. The inner, middle and outer circles measure 30m, 60m and 90m in diameter respectively, with a central arrow bisecting the target and pointing almost due south. The RAF bombing target appears to overlay the location of the earlier Trevallen Downs Middle Range Target's pop-up or swivel target. \nAerial photographic evidence suggests that the circular target was constructed between 1946 and 1968. The NW quadrant of the RAF bombing target was built over the round impact zone, suggesting that it was constructed once the army range was disused. \n\nCadet training range and other structures on Trevallen Downs, St Govans Head. Castlemartin Range were established in 1938 and used until 1945 for tank training by the Royal Armoured Corps. It was briefly returned to agricultural use after the war, but was acquired by the War Department in 1948 and pressed back into service in 1951 with the advent of the Korean War (1950-3). It remained as a specialist tank training range, often hosting German units, until 1995, when training activities were broadened to include infantry and small arms training. The Trevallan Downs complex dates to the Second World War and comprises an inland firing point to the north-west where cadets would fire at coastal targets using tanks. Once this task had been mastered they would progress to firing whilst driving over bumpy terrain and more demanding battle runs.\n\nThis range incorporates the later, well-preserved concentric circular bombing target utilised by RAF Brawdy. See documentation relating to the Cadw scheduling (PE533) in September 2008 for comprehensive historical summary and field description by J. Berry of the range. \n\nSee comments for more information.",

She was there for ten years until she married and her husband wasn't happy that she was out working long hours and then coming home and keeping house. She was offered a job as secretary to Mr Metcalfe in a  factory making small machinery, built by the council to provide work for local boys.

The factory produced elasticated waist trousers for M&amp;S. There were no cutters there and each one sewed a different part of the garment. Eileem feels that farm girls are used to hard work. They had detailed instructions (e.g. how many stitches an inch) from M&amp;S. Eileen did some checking of goods, then became a floater. She wasn&#39;t fast enough to be on the line. She also worked making jeans in the Lampeter factory. After leaving college she worked for a while in a small factory in Kenfig Hill making clothes from Welsh flannel. When checking in Slimma&#39;s it was difficult to tell a worker to re-do the work. She became a supervisor. Dispute would arise when machines broke and the work was on stop. The girls had no ambition. Not a union member. The heaps of trousers absorbed the noise. Health and Safety &ndash; carrying heavy weight. Some of the girls went to the pub after pay on Fridays. They had a turkey each at Xmas. She left to get married.</p>",

Bu hefyd yn ffatri Llambed ar y jÃ®ns. Ar Ã´l gadael coleg bu mewn ffatri fach ym Mynydd Cynffig yn gwneud dillad o frethyn Cymreig. Wrth tsiecio yn Slimma roedd yn anodd dweud wrth weithiwr am ail-wneud rhywbeth. Cafodd swydd goruchwylwraig. Byddai cynnen os byddai peiriannau&#39;n torri a&#39;r gwaith ar stop.

She wove the bandages. The experience was horrendous. The factory moved to Garnant. It was cold and the workers walked out (1962). They were employed instantly in Corgi&#39;s. She worked as a linker, progressing to production. Patricia became a trainer and supervisor. Highly skilled work. She notes the gauges etc.; dancing to rock and roll songs on the radio, cleanliness; building up speed; completed garments sent back to Surrey to be finished. Paine&#39;s (1966) did the whole process. In Corgi&#39;s there was a crÃ¨che &ndash; but closed because of regulations. She worked as an outworker when children were small (c.1968-73). Some jobs were better payers than others. As staff, not in a Union. Increased Health and Safety regulations. Xmas celebrations - decorating the floor and machines; dinner. Social clubs &ndash; and trips. Patricia has tinnitus &ndash; from factory work. Visit by Princess Anne. Factory closed in 1998 &ndash; she worked there 33 years.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Enid left school at 16 (1965) and Bronwen at 16 (1964). Lack of transport meant it was difficult to find work if you lived in the country. Enid joined her brother in Milford Haven. Worked on picking potatoes and then in Croydon Asbestos (c.1966-68/9). She finished off leather gloves. Target &ndash; finishing 3200 gloves a week &ndash; a minute per glove. They were given premium bonds with their wages. Good working conditions: no side effects from asbestos. Bronwen looked after children before starting in Deva Dogware and she had left Deva Dogware before Enid started (c.1966-68). The working conditions were poor in DD but the workers facilitated the work. Enid made slip collars for dogs. She liked the mess. She remembers welding by gas; exporting the collars; listening to Wimbledon on the radio. Enid helped sell collars at Crufts &ndash; there were important people there. Poor conditions at Deva Dogware. Enid left to have a child, then returned until the factory closed (c. 1968/9-1972).</p>",

Aeth Enid at ei brawd yn Aberdaugleddau a bu&#39;n tynnu tatws ac yna yn Croydon Asbestos (tua 1966 tan 1968/9). Roedd hi&#39;n cau menig lledr. Targed - cau 3200 (ansicr) o fenig yr wythnos. Munud y faneg. Gweld grwpiau fel yr Hollies yn y Masonic Hall. Ennill &#39;premium bond&#39; at eu cyflog. Amodau gwaith da- dim sgil effeithiau asbestos. Bu Bronwen yn gofalu am blant cyn dechrau yn Deva Dogwear ac roedd wedi gorffen yno cyn i Enid ddechrau (c. 1966-68). Roedd yr amodau yn wael yn DD ond roedd y gweithwyr yn hwyluso&#39;r gwaith. Gwneud coleri slip i gÅµn yr oedd Enid. Hoffai&#39;r annibendod. Cofia weldio gyda nwy; allforio&#39;r coleri, gwrando ar Wimbeldon ar y radio. Bu Enid yn gwerthu coleri yn Crufts - pobl bwysig yno. Amodau gwael yn DD. Gadawodd Enid i gael babi, a dychwelodd nes i&#39;r ffatri gau (tua 1968/9-1972).</p>",

It was difficult to get in there &ndash; you had to pull strings. Making coils for aeroplanes. When they started making watches she went on inspection on the Anglo site - a beautiful dust-proof building. In the beginning she was too frightened to go to the toilet. The boys in the automatic department used to whistle. In the dust-proof area &ndash; special rubber shoes and overalls. Making c.3000 watches a day (setting them by hand), and on to a further 7 regulation racks before ready. She was also a floater. When the Enfield clock factory opened she trained for the swing shift (4.30-9.30), mainly married women &ndash;friction with day shift, because they were hitting targets. Marriages announced in Tick Tock magazine. Her husband was a shop steward with AEU. Strict rules &ndash; Personnel Officer. Back injury &ndash; because of factory? When she got married in 1951 her colleagues gave her an Enfield clock. Dancing classes, dances and trips. The new young workers (1980s) had no respect and used bad language.</p>",

            "description": "Moses Roberts was born in Glan Llyn, Cefn Brith, Uwchaled in 1893. His brother Bob joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1914, and was soon sent to fight in France. Moses joined the army in November, 1915, and another brother, Aron, joined a week later. Moses first served with the RWF, then with the Labour Corps and the RAMC (Royal Army Medical Corps). This photograph shows him in uniform wearing a cap with a badge which seems to be the Army Service Corps insignia. Moses wrote his reminiscences about his life in 1979 when aged 86, and they were published in the Transactions of the Denbighshire Historical Society in 2007. In this he writes of enjoying his period of training in Kinmel Bay and then: \"I moved from Kinmel to Wrexham, where I received the kindest attention. Then, to my dismay, I moved from Wrexham to Oswestry and I do not have a good word to say about the place. We wished to be deployed somewhere and so it happened and we went to France in March 1916. Well, that was hell - every war is hell. We were there until the Armistice occurred on November 11th. I had to wait until March 1918 [sic- presumably 1919]. I was thankful to return home, along with Bob and Aron, from the whole business. ... There was much talk of the angels of Mons and some rogues were making big money by selling cars with images of the angels on them. I was angered by this, as I never saw a single angel while in France but I saw plenty of demons, indeed, demons in human form, the pompous officers some of whom were not fit to tie my shoelaces.\"",
            "descriptionCy": "Ganwyd Moses Roberts yn Nglan Llyn, Cefn Brith, Uwchaled yn 1893. Fe ymunodd ei frawd Bob Ã¢'r Ffiwsilwyr Cymreig Brenhinol (Royal Welch Fusiliers) ym 1914, gan gael ei ddanfon yn fuan iawn yn Ffrainc.Ymunodd Moses Ã¢'r fyddin ym mis Tachwedd, 1915 ac fe ymunodd brawd arall, Aron, o fewn wythnos. Gwasanaethodd Moses yn gyntaf gyda'r RWF, yna gyda'r Labour Corps a'r RAMC (Royal Army Medical Corps). Dengys y llun hwn Moses yn iwnifform gan gwisgo cap Ã¢ bathodyn sy'n edrych fel un yr ASC. Ysgrifennodd ei atgofion am ei fywyd yn 1979 pan yn 86 oed, ac fe'u cyhoeddwyd yn Nhrafodion Cymdeithas Hanes Sir Ddinbych yn 2007. Yn hwn mae'n sÃ´n am fwynhau'r cyfnod o hyfforddi ym Mae Kinmel, ac yna: \"Symudais o Kinmel i Wrecsam ac yno eto cefais y caredigrwydd mwyaf.Er gofid i mi symudais o Wrecsam i Groesoswallt ac nid oes gennyf air da am y lle. Dymunem am gael ein symud i rywle ac felly y bu, a hynny i Ffrainc ym mis Mawrth 1916. Wel! dyna yw uffern - mae pob rhyfel yn uffern. B&ucirc;m yno tan ddaeth y Cadoediad ar Dachwedd yr unfed ar ddeg. Bu raid imi aros tan fis Mawrth 1918 [1919 siwr o fod]. Diolch oeddwn am gael dod adref a hefyd Bob ac Aron o'r heldrin fawr. ... Yr oedd llawer o sÃ´n am angylion 'Mons' a rhyw dacle yn gwneud arian mawr yn gwerthu'r cardiau a darluniau o'r angylion. 'Roeddwn yn ffieiddio at y fath beth, gan na welais i yr un angel pan yn Ffrainc ond mi welais gythreuliaid, ie, a hynny mewn bodau dynol, y crach swyddogion nad oedd rhai ohonynt yn deilwng i ddatod carai fy esgidiau.\"",

            "description": "Lede\nDiscovering the past in Fishguard and Goodwick.\n\nStory\nEin Hanes/Our History is a collection of memories and memorabilia that offers visitors a glimpse into the story of the Twin Towns. Itâs located in Fishguard Square, occupying the premises of an old shop two doors up from the Town Hall and Last Invasion Tapestry gallery. Ein Hanes was established in 2016 on the initiative of local people with support from Pembrokeshire County Council. Itâs organised and run entirely by volunteers many of whom have long memories and wide knowledge of the area. Others are incomers who are interested in local history and are keen to share it with visitors.\n\nEin Hanes contains a wealth of historical material in the form of maps, photographs, newspapers, books, images and objects of interest, from prehistory to living memory: much of this has been shared or donated by local people. Youâre welcome to wander round, browse, take photographs or ask questions â weâll do our best to provide answers. We can also give advice on where to go, how to reach particular places or find the most photogenic views. Some visitors have queries about local ancestors and, although these are best directed to the County Archives, we may be able to suggest contacts and connections. (Our sister project, the Hanes Abergwaun website, is another mine of information, easily accessible online.)\n\nTopics featured at Ein Hanes include: the prehistory of the area, the development of the twin towns from fishing harbour to international port, the French Invasion of 1797, the coming of the railway in 1899, the age of the Cunard liners, the first flight from Britain to Ireland in 1912, local events in both World Wars, the film locations used for Moby Dick and Under Milk Wood, and more recent history. Eye-catching window displays employ local items and art work to illustrate traditional rural and maritime life.\n\nEin Hanes is open 5 days a week from March to October. Thereâs no entry charge: financially it relies upon donations, the sale of cards and booklets, and generous terms for its rented premises. During the winter months we offer a series of talks on historical subjects and thereâs a Facebook page that shares news and information. Moves are being made to progress to museum status in a new location â thatâs for the future. Meanwhile every visitor helps to pave the way: we welcome your interest.",
            "descriptionCy": "Lede\nDarganfod y gorffennol yn Abergwaun ac Wdig\n\nStori\nMae Ein Hanes yn gasgliad o atgofion a phethau cofiadwy syân cynnig cipolwg i ymwelwyr o storiâr Ddwy Dref. Feâi lleolir yn SgwÃ¢r Abergwaun, mewn hen siop sydd ddau ddrws i fyny o Neuadd y Dref ac oriel Tapestri yr Ymosodiad Olaf.\n\nSefydlwyd Ein Hanes yn 2016 ar gais pobl leol gyda chymorth Cyngor Sir Penfro. Caiff ei drefnu aâi redeg yn llwyr gan wirfoddolwyr, y mae gan nifer ohonynt hen atgofion a gwybodaeth eang am yr ardal. Mae eraill yn bobl sydd wedi symud iâr ardal ac y mae ganddynt ddiddordeb mewn hanes lleol, ac maent yn awyddus iâw rannu gydag ymwelwyr.\n\nMae Ein Hanes yn cynnwys cyfoeth o ddeunydd hanesyddol ar ffurf mapiau, ffotograffau, papurau newydd, llyfrau, delweddau a gwrthrychau o ddiddordeb, o gyfnod cynhanes iâr cyfnod sydd o fewn cof pobl syân fyw heddiw: rhannwyd neu roddwyd cryn dipyn o hwn gan bobl leol. Mae croeso i chi grwydro o gwmpas, pori trwyâr deunydd, tynnu lluniau neu holi cwestiynau â byddwn yn gwneud ein gorau i gynnig atebion i chi. Gallwn gynnig cyngor hefyd ynghylch ble i fynd, sut i gyrraedd mannau penodol neu sicrhauâr golygfeydd mwyaf ffotogenig. Mae gan rai ymwelwyr ymholiadau am gyndeidiau lleol ac er ei bod yn well troi at Archifauâr Sir gydag ymholiadau oâr fath, efallai y byddwn yn gallu awgrymu cysylltiadau. (Mae ein prosiect cysylltiedig, gwefan Hanes Abergwaun, yn adnodd arall syân llawn gwybodaeth, ac y maeân hawdd troi ato ar-lein).\n\nMae pynciau o fewn Ein Hanes yn cynnwys: cynhanes yr ardal, datblygiad y ddwy dref o fod yn harbwr pysgota i fod yn borthladd rhyngwladol, Ymosodiad y Ffrancod ym 1797, dyfodiad y rheilffordd ym 1899, oes llongau mawrion Cunard, y daith gyntaf mewn awyren rhwng Prydain ac Iwerddon ym 1912, digwyddiadau lleol yn ystod y ddau Ryfel Byd, y lleoliadau ffilm a ddefnyddiwyd ar gyfer Moby Dick ac Under Milk Wood, a hanes mwy diweddar. Mae arddangosiadau ffenestr deniadol yn defnyddio eitemau lleol a gwaith celf i ddangos bywyd morol a gwledig traddodiadol.\n\nMae Ein Hanes ar agor 5 diwrnod yr wythnos rhwng mis Mawrth a mis Hydref. Ni chodir tÃ¢l mynediad: maeân dibynnu ar roddion, gwerthu cardiau a llyfrynnau, ac amodau hael ar gyfer y safle y maeân ei rentu. Dros fisoedd y gaeaf, rydym yn cynnig cyfres o anerchiadau am faterion hanesyddol a cheir tudalen Face book syân rhannu newyddion a gwybodaeth. Mae camau yn cael eu cymryd i sicrhau statws amgueddfa mewn lleoliad newydd â rhywbeth ar gyfer y dyfodol. Yn y cyfamser, mae pob ymwelydd yn helpu i baratoiâr ffordd: rydym yn croesawu eich diddordeb.",

            "description": "Set adjacent to St Michaelâs is a large field used today to pasture horses. If you look closely, within that field there are a number of earthwork platforms â the building platforms of abandoned crofts (Medieval houses). Another, probably the remains of a post-medieval house of two rooms is in the field to the north of the church, and the remains of a small cottage (now just a mound) are located to the south. Further remains of a longhouse (the Green House) are located around 150m east of the church\n\nThe whole complex represents an abandoned Medieval village that once surrounded the church and overlooked the River Ely.  The village was bounded on the west by the Church and east by a moated manor house (The Court). The settlement originated as a small mense manor held of the Chief Lords of Glamorgan. In the 14th century it was in possession of the Fleming family and in the 15th century by the Malefant family. The existence of the church by 1254 suggests the village was established by the mid 13th century. There appears to have been depopulation in the later medieval period and in 1801 the population of the parish was only 53. The shrinkage was probably due to amalgamation of small farms into larger units. \n\nHowever, local folklaw has it that a village farmer sold his soul to the devil so that his fields would produce bountiful harvests. Unfortuntely he reneged on the deal and the devil cursed the land around the village causing the villagers to starve and eventually leave the land!!",

            "description": "Lede\nThe practise of visiting a well to ask for a blessing is a centuries old tradition in Wales. Cursing oneâs mortal enemy, however, is a much more recent practise.\n\nStory\nThe veneration of saints and their holy wells has a long tradition across Wales. The wells around Holyhead are no different. Their former use and importance reflects centuries old traditions and changes in attitudes towards life and folk beliefs.\n\nLying just to the west below Holyhead Mountain are the ruins of Capel Lochwydd, labelled âCapel Yloughwidâ on John Speedâs map of Anglesey from 1610. Having been ruined now for well over a century, not much more than the wall foundations can still be seen here. Dedicated to an unknown saint, its well used to flow from a cleft in the rocks nearby, but has since dried up. According to local legend, the well was popular with visitors who wanted to divine their future spouse. Taking a mouthful of water from the well and with gravel in each hand, the devotee would walk back to the church and deposit all on the altar stone of the little church without spilling anything. If successful, they were to marry their intended within a year.\n\nAccording to folk belief, wells that overflowed to the south carried cursing powers. At nearby village Penrhos, locals visited a well that was supposed to have restorative as well as cursing powers. It was said that the water was able to cure cancer if the patient bathed in the water. Alternatively, by uttering curses and dropping pins around the well, visitors could afflict their enemies with cancer. By the mid-nineteenth century, the well was in such great demand that repeated damage to the surrounding property caused the farmer on whose land it was situated to destroy the well by draining it.\n\nFurther east near Llaneilian, Anglesey, Ffynnon Elian also served as a cursing well. The person seeking revenge would deposit silver pennies in the nail-studded alms chest (cyff Elian) located in the nearby church. Excavations of the well in 1925 discovered a small slate to which a wax effigy had been pinned. As was common with small cursing tablets, various letters had been scratched into the surface of the slate, wishing misfortune on âRFâ.\n\nIn Wales, the practise of visiting wells for their restorative, healing powers had been in place for centuries. Using wells to cast curses only developed in the second half of the eighteenth century and only lasted for about one hundred years.\n\nFactoid\n- Ffynnon Elian on Anglesey was said to have exceptional healing powers similar to those of St Winefrideâs Well at Holywell.\n- There is another cursing well named Ffynnon Elian at Llaneilian-yn-Rhos, Conwy.\n- Even after the Reformation, the people in Wales continued to visit holy wells dedicated to saints.",
            "descriptionCy": "Lede\nMae'r arfer o ymweld Ã¢ ffynnon i ofyn am fendith yn draddodiad yng Nghymru ers canrifoedd. Ond rhywbeth llawer mwy diweddar yw melltithioâch gelynion pennaf.\n\nStori\nMae yna draddodiad hir ledled Cymru o barchuâr saint a'u ffynhonnau sanctaidd. Ac mae hyn yn cynnwys y ffynhonnau o amgylch Caergybi. Mae eu hen ddefnydd a'u pwysigrwydd yn adlewyrchu arfer y canrifoedd a newidiadau mewn agweddau tuag at fywyd ac yng nghredoauâr werin.\n\nYchydig iâr gorllewin islaw Mynydd Twr mae adfeilion Capel Lochwydd, sydd wedi'i labelu fel 'Capel Yloughwid' ar fap John Speed o Ynys MÃ´n ym 1610. Gan ei fod yn adfail ers ymhell dros ganrif, does dim modd gweld llawer mwy na sylfeini'r waliau erbyn hyn. Roedd y ffynnon, sydd wedi'i chysegru i sant anhysbys, yn arfer llifo o hollt yn y creigiau gerllaw, ond mae wedi sychu bellach. Yn Ã´l y chwedl leol, roedd y ffynnon yn boblogaidd ymysg ymwelwyr a oedd am ganfod pwy fyddai eu gÅµr neu eu gwraig yn y dyfodol. Wedi cymryd llond ceg o ddÅµr o'r ffynnon a chodi graean ym mhob llaw, byddai'r credinwyr yn cerdded yn Ã´l i'r eglwys ac yn gosod y cyfan ar allor garreg yr eglwys fach heb ollwng dim. Pe baen nhwân llwyddiannus, fe fydden nhwân priodi eu darpar briod o fewn blwyddyn.\n\nYn Ã´l coel gwlad, roedd gan ffynhonnau a oedd yn gorlifo tuaâr de y pÅµer i felltithio. Ym mhentref cyfagos Penrhos, ymwelaiâr bobl leol Ã¢ ffynnon a oedd i fod Ã¢ phwerau i iachÃ¡u yn ogystal Ã¢ melltithio. Dywedid bod y dÅµr yn gallu iachÃ¡u canser pe bai'r claf yn ymdrochi ynddo. Fel arall, drwy lefaru melltithion a gollwng pinnau o amgylch y ffynnon, gallai ymwelwyr wneud iâw gelynion ddioddef canser. Erbyn canol y bedwaredd ganrif ar bymtheg, roedd cymaint o alw am y ffynnon nes bod y difrod mynych i'r eiddo cyfagos wedi achosi i'r ffermwr oedd biauâr tir lle roedd y ffynnon fynd ati i ddinistrio'r ffynnon drwy ei draenio.\n\nYmhellach i'r dwyrain ger Llaneilian, roedd Ffynnon Eilian hefyd yn iachÃ¡u. Byddai'r sawl a oedd yn ceisio taluâr pwyth yn gosod ceiniogau arian mewn cist elusennol arbennig (cyff Eilian) yn yr eglwys gyfagos. Wrth gloddio'r ffynnon ym 1925, daethpwyd o hyd i lechen fach a delw gwyr fach wediâi phinio iddi. Fel roedd yn gyffredin gyda thabledi melltithio bach, roedd llythrennau wedi'u crafu ar wyneb y llechen, gan ddymuno anffawd i 'RF'.\n\nYng Nghymru, roedd pobl wedi bod yn ymweld Ã¢ ffynhonnau yn sgil eu pwerau i iachÃ¡u ers canrifoedd.

About 8 women to every man. Female designer. He worked in patent room â describes process of making patent of teddy bearâs limbs etc. Then to stampers, cutters, stitchers on assembly, stuffers, then to inspection. Girls nice and decent. Yet some teasing. In Weston Biscuits (later Burton's Biscuits) â tannoy music playing Housewifeâs Choice. Government Sponsored scheme for disabled workers in HG Stone â âgreen cardâ men. Class differences in the factory and in school. Jim also worked in the biscuit factory â6 million eaten everyday!â as a yard boy- empty tins flattened for scrap metal. Remembers all the women singing; class divide between office and floor.  He also worked at Pilkingtonâs glassworks one holiday â yard boy; hard and monotonous work. Lot of cutting of glass â dangerous work. Through factory work he appreciated âwhat it was like to be at the bottom of the pile.â  They were direct, fresh and frank people. The experience stood him in good stead in his life.",

Roedd tua 8 menyw am bob dyn. Menyw yn gynllunydd. Gweithiai yn y stafell batent - disgrifiaâr broses o wneud patent ar gyfer coes tedi. Yna ai at y stampwyr, y torwyr, y pwythwyr ar y llinell, yna at y stwffwyr ac yna iâw archwilio. Merched neis a pharchus yno.  Eto roedd peth tynnu coes. Yn Westonâs Biscuits (wedyn Burton's Biscuits) - roedd 'tannoy' yn chwarae 'Housewives Choice'. Yn HG Stone roedd cynllun noddwyd gan y llywodraeth ar gyfer gweithwyr anabl - dynion âcerdyn gwyrddâ. Gwahaniaethau dosbarth yn y ffatri. Gweithiodd Jim yn y ffatri fisgedi aâr slogan â6 million eaten everyday!â hefyd fel gwas yr iard, yn fflatio tuniau gwag yn fetel sgrap. Cofia'r menywod yn canu; rhaniad dosbarth rhwng gweithwyr y swyddfa aâr llawr. Buân Pilkingtonâs Glassworks hefyd un gwyliau fel gwas yr iard eto; gwaith caled ac undonog. Llawer o dorri gwydr - gwaith peryglus. Trwy weithio yn y ffatrÃ¯oedd maeân gwerthfawrogi sut brofiad yw 'bod ar waelod y pentwr.â Roedden nhwân bobl uniongyrchol, ffraeth a ffres.
